# AGT-2025: AI-Generated Text 2025

**AGT-2025** is a custom-constructed test dataset introduced in the thesis *"Detecting Machine-Generated Text Across Granularity, Domains, and LLMs"* (2025). It is designed to evaluate how well existing detection models generalize to machine-generated text from **state-of-the-art LLMs** released in 2025, namely **GPT-4.5** and **DeepSeek R1**.

## 📦 Dataset Structure

AGT-2025 includes **both English and Chinese** samples. Each language subset contains:

- **Human-written texts** sourced from *HC3* and *M4GT* datasets, with no overlap with training data.
- **AI-generated texts** produced by:
  - **GPT-4.5** (via question-based generation)
  - **DeepSeek R1** (via summary-based rewriting)

Each sample includes a binary label:
- `0` = human-written  
- `1` = machine-generated

## 🛠️ Dataset Construction

AGT-2025 was built using two distinct generation pipelines:

### 1. Question-Based Generation (HC3-style)

- Prompt: Human-written question from HC3
- Generator: GPT-4.5 or DeepSeek R1
- Output: LLM-generated QA-style response

### 2. Summary-Based Rewriting (M4GT-style)

- Source: Long human-written document from M4GT
- Step 1: Summarized into a short 10–20 word prompt
- Step 2: Prompt input to GPT-4.5 or DeepSeek R1
- Output: A rewritten version, stylistically diverse yet domain-aligned

Prompting and generation were performed in clean sessions with no prior memory or history, ensuring high diversity and independence.
