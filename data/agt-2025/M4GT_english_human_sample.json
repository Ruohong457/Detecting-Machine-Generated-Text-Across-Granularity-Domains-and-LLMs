        "text":"Joseph Gluckstein Links  (13 December 1904 – 1 October 1997) was a British author, art historian, and furrier who is principally known for his expertise and works on the Venetian painter Canaletto and for Venice for Pleasure, a travel guide to Venice, Italy.\n\nEarly life\n\nJoseph Gluckstein Links was born on 13 December 1904 in London, United Kingdom, to Katey (née Symons, 1 February 1882 - 29 August 1918) and Calman Links (1868 – 16 August 1925).\nJoseph or Joe, he was commonly called, had two younger siblings, Eileen Hannah Links (25 August 1909 – 1982) and Joyce Links (15 October 1914 – ).\n\nHis father was a Jewish refugee from Hungary who had co-founded the fur business, Calman Links. \nHis mother died in 1918 before he was 13 years old. Two years later his father learned that he was also terminally ill. With no time to spare, he removed his son from school in order before he died to teach him the fur trade in general and how to run the business.\n\n\"I was an unwilling and sullen pupil,\" Links wrote, but he later appreciated that forced him into a career. \"There was the business and I jolly well had to go and earn my living at it.\"\n\nCareer\n\nFurrier \n\nWhile his father had mostly traded in skunk skins and thus the low end of the fur trade, Links after taking responsibility for the business moved it upmarket. In the 1920s, fur was very popular in the fashion world with every woman wanting a fur coat. By the 1930s, Calman Links was one of its most prominent furriers in London, which at the time was the epicenter of a booming luxury fur trade. Even the Great Depression had little impact on Calman Links.\n\nFor many years the business was located at 33 Margaret Street, London.\n\nCalman Links eventually gained the royal warrant and Links was for a period a director of the Hudson's Bay Company, and served as President of the British Fur Trade Alliance.\n\nIn 1956, Links wrote a book on fur, The Book of Fur.\n\nBeginning of his writing career \n\nLinks was a friend of Nancy Robinson heiress to the Nugget Boot Polish fortune who, married Dennis Wheatley in 1922. The two men became lifetime friends and remained so after Wheatley's and Robinson divorced in 1930. The pair shared a taste for luxury, most notably in the form of good cigars and expensive wines. As Wheatley attempted to write his first novel, Links supported him with advice and by lending money.\n\nOne night over dinner, circa 1935, Links suggested to Wheatley they consider cooperating to produce a murder mystery in the form of a dossier of clues.\nFor a period Wheatley was unconvinced as Links had no background in writing, yet alone game design. Wheatley was by now in demand as a writer, but had no experience in writing detective novels.  Worn down by Links' persistence Wheatley approached his publisher, Hutchinson, but they were lukewarm as it would be expensive to produce and was not something they had experience in. In order to keep  Wheatley happy, they finally agreed, provided Links and Wheatley would be willing to accept no royalties at all on the first 10,000 copies sold, and one penny per copy after that. Links and Wheatley agreed to these terms. Links planned the mystery and devised the clues, while Wheatley wrote the text of the included documents. As Wheatley's name was known to the reading public, the dossier was credited to Wheatley, with a “planned by J.G. Links” below in smaller letters.\n\nTheir first effort Murder off Miami was published on 23 July 1936 at a price of 3 shillings and 6 pence. Initially bookstall and bookshop managers was largely negative as they were difficult to display and it was felt that they were too innovative for general consumption. To over counter this apprehension Wheatley entertained numerous London bookshop managers which convinced them to take a small number.\n\nSelfridges agreed to take 1,000 copies, provided Wheatley signed each one, which he gladly did. 120,000 copies were sold in six months and it went on to sell over 200,000 copies in Britain in its first year. Queen Mary purchased six copies from Hatchards. It was translated into several other languages.\n\nAlthough there had been ‘solve it yourself’ crime books in the past, such as the ‘Baffle Books’ created by Lassiter Wren and Randle McKay, Links and Wheatley took it to another level, by providing a cardboard folder containing all the evidence that an investigating team of detectives might gather. In the folder was a variety of reports, testimonies, letters, as well as physical clues such as hairs or pills. The reader had to inspect this evidence to solve the mystery before checking his conclusion with the actual solution, concealed within a sealed section towards the rear of the folder. In all four 'Crime Dossiers' were published, the others being Who Killed Robert Prentice?, The Malinsay Massacre, and Herewith The Clues!.\n\nSome of the letters in Who Killed Robert Prentice? were scented with unique perfumes, providing vital clues about their origins, while there was a torn-up photograph of the victim cavorting with a naked woman. The reader had to reassemble this photograph to obtain a clue.\n\nThe crime dossiers were very popular both in Britain and around the world. When published in Germany, the Nazi Chamber of Literature and the Ministry of Propaganda took a dim view of Who Killed Robert Prentice claiming that the main protagonist, Cicely Prentice, was a woman whose \"moral character must be designated more than inferior\". For many years it had been assumed that as a result it had been banned, but evidence has surfaced that there was pre-war German edition.\n\nBeginning in 1979 with Murder off Miami all four were reissued by Hutchinson in facsimile over the next three years, ending with Herewith the Clues in 1982 to modest press notices and modest sales.\n\nIn 1986, Webb and Bower in conjunction with Michael Joseph, unsuccessfully published the crime dossiers in glossy hardback editions, with the physical clues reduced to photographs.\n\nWorld War II \n\nDuring the Second World War, Links served as a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force working on barrage balloons in the Air Ministry.\n\nA chance meeting during his military service bought him into contact with Robert Lutyens, son of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Through Robert Lutyen, Links, a longtime bachelor met his sister, Mary, whom he subsequently married in 1945.\n\nVenice \n\nInitially, Links proposed having their honeymoon on a troopship going to New York, but Mary's objection led to the selection of Venice as a more suitable option.\n\nThis first visit for both of them to Venice resulted in them becoming instantly captivated and for the next 30 years, they visited Venice two–three times a year. In the late 1960s, Links became involved in the establishment of the Venice in Peril Fund, a fund to prevent the buildings of Venice from crumbling into its lagoon. Both Links and Mary supported it for the rest of their lives.\n\nAlready an admirer of art critic John Ruskin, Links took along on one of their early visits to Venice, a copy of The Stones of Venice, which lead to Mary writing biographies of both Ruskin and his wife, Effie Gray.\n\nCanaletto \n\nAs a result of fascination with Venice, Links developed in interest in Venetian painter Canaletto. In 1962 Mary gave Links a copy of William G. Constable's recently published monograph on Canaletto, which mentioned a missing painting by the artist. Links recognized it as the painting hanging over his sister-in-law's fireplace and passed this information on to Constable, leading to the two men corresponding. When Constable meet Links in person he asked him to take over revising the book for its second edition. The task took Links six years rather than the six months Constable had anticipated., the resulting book Canaletto: Giovanni Antonio Canal, 1697-1768 when published in 1976 lead to Links who was self-taught and had no formal training becoming recognized as a world expert on Canaletto.\n\nVenice for pleasure \n\nIn reply to his friends constantly asked for advice prior to visiting Venice, Links would write letters describing what to see and do. One such friend intending to visit the city was the publisher Max Reinhardt, of The Bodley Head, to whom Links provided advice in such a letter. Reinhardt's client Charles Chaplin and his wife also found the advice of benefit, which engaged Reinhardt to ask Links to write a book on the subject.\n\nThe result was Venice for Pleasure which upon its publication in 1966 received favourable reviews, with Bernard Levin in The Times stating, \"Not only the best guide-book to that city ever written, but the best guide-book to any city ever written.\"\n\nJames Mustich listed the book in his 1,000 Books To Read Before You Die: A Life-Changing List  offering the opinion that \"Links weaves a spell that evokes the joy of urban wanderings the enduring fascination of beauty, the ambience of time, and the pleasure of coming upon a welcoming cafe at just the moment one's feet need a rest and one's mind a respite.\"\n\nA fifth expanded edition was published in 1994 and by 2015 it was in its ninth edition.\n\nDeath \n\nHe died at his London home on 1 October 1997.\n\nPersonal life \n\nLinks married writer Mary Lutyens (31 July 1908 – 9 April 1999) in 1945, with the marriage ending with his death. While the couple had no children of their own, Links was stepfather to Mary's daughter Amanda Lutyens Sewell by her previous marriage.\n\nHonours \n\nLinks was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his wartime service in 1946.\n\nBibliography \n\nHe wrote his books using the name, J.

        "text":"As the end of a school year comes to a close, the summer is just beginning. Many during summer use it as a time to have fun and take a break from school. Some schools though require students to complete a summer project to ensure learning continues throughout the year. This can help to make sure that the student mind is awake and ready to learn when the start of the new school year begins. The basis for summer projects to assure continuous learning should be student-designed   creative projects would be produced  it would give students an opportunity to take control of their education.\n During the school year, students go from class to class completing the required work to excel. In most cases, this requires sitting through a lecture followed by an activity and homework. All of which are teacher-designed. For this reason, summer projects should be student-designed.  Student-designed projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education  Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow. The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about. For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture. With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests. As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns. If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher. Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education.\n When a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed. To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects. For example, if there are 20 students in a class with one teacher and the teacher assigns a project, there will be 20 of the same project that return because of the guidelines that the teacher established when creating the project. But if every one of the 20 students got to design their own project, there will be 20 different projects that come back to be presented. This will happen because the students will feel more personally connected to their project. Students won't feel as if it is a project the teachers gave them but rather something fun to do over the summer. Having a summer project that is designed by an individual, the teacher, for a group, the students, will create a detriment to creativity.  Some may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year.  This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work. Continuing to have teachers dictate the types of projects students complete year round will not prepare them for the world. A student-designed project would prepare students better for the world.  Once the students enter the world, there won't always be a teacher telling them how to complete the task assigned to them. Giving students the opportunity to experience independence over the summer is a perfect way to prepare them for the world. Preparing students for the world out of school is more important than preparing them for a few weeks in the future when school starts.  Schools that require students to complete a summer project should make the projects student-designed. Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education. Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education. But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more. A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking. Making sure that students are positively active in their education is crucial to developing a well rounded individual.",

Plants, during photosynthesis, take in carbon dioxide, or a molecule made up of a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, water, and photons in sunlight to create dioxygen and glucose.  When animals take in glucose and dioxygen through respiration, the mitochondria in our cells essentially reverse this process, creating carbon dioxide, which you exhale, water, and energy. \n\nNitrogen, while being more abundant, does not have the same sort of elemental properties.  While we need Nitrogen to live, plants and animals (except some bacteria) cannot convert elemental Nitrogen in the air into a form in which it is usable,  which is why Nitrates in soil are so important in agriculture, because that is a form of Nitrogen that can be taken in by plants, converted to amino acids, and consumed by animals.",

America's founders are retroactively described as having \"liberal\" ideals because they claimed to be rebelling to protect \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\", and because the government they designed tried to protect as many rights and liberties of the citizens as possible.\n\nLiberalism has always been associated with other more specific ideas that the most famous liberal thinkers and movements advanced at the same time as \"liberty\" in the abstract.  For example, Locke and Montesquieu were associated with checks-and-balances. The Enlightenment *philosophes* were associated with free speech. The American revolutionaries were associated with self-determination.  The French revolutionaries were associated with rationalizing and modernizing convoluted medieval legal and administrative systems.  The English Whigs\/Liberal Party were associated with *laissez-faire*, aka free trade, and with individualism.  \n\nIn *Europe*, towards the end of the 19th century, there was a three-way struggle between the remnants of the old aristocracy (who tended to be called Conservatives), the representatives of the bourgeoisie (who tended to be called Liberals or something equally inoffensive), and the ascendant working classes (who tended to be called Labor or Socialist).  This three-way struggle was inherently unstable.  In most countries it started as a Conservative\/Liberal struggle with the Socialists undermining the liberal side, and then became a Conservative\/Socialist struggle with the liberals undermining the socialist side.  Eventually every country had a sort of reformation of the party system which allowed the left-wing liberals to join the moderate socialists and the right-wing liberals to join the moderate aristocrats.  As Keynes jokes, \"The job of the Liberal Party is to give the Tories their leaders and Labor their ideas.\"\n\nIn the US things were totally different.  We never had a landed aristocracy on the scale of Europe, and we never had a successful socialist\/labor party.  Instead we had various urban machines competing to organize immigrant laborers into political constituencies, and we had a weird quasi-ethnic party system that developed out of our Civil War, with the Democrats originally being the traitors and the people who were disenchanted with the post-war Union elite, and the Republicans being the victorious Unionists and abolitionists.  Because there was this weird element of ethnic allegiance and regionalism in US party politics it was possible to have a left-wing and a right-wing in both parties.  The left-wing was called liberal and the right-wing conservative (consistent with 19th c. practices in both continents).  When the great realignment finally happened and Southern conservatives started to join the Republican party and Northern liberals started to join the Democratic party, the liberal\/conservative labels stuck.",

However, each cone is still excited by a range of neighboring wavelengths, to a various degree that diminishes the further you get from the center wavelength. \n\n\nWhen a yellow wavelength hits your retina, red and green are both somewhat excited, since yellow sits in between red and green. Your brain knows that those two receptors acting together means yellow. By the way, that also means that if your eye gets hit with 2 separate waves, one red, one green, you will see yellow. That how your TV works. \n\nThis system has a hack. The color spectrum is linear, but your brain treats it like a loop. Even though, physically, no single color sits between red and blue, your brain still fills in this phantom state: red and blue *but not green* activated. That's magenta. It's achieved by mixing red and blue light. \n\nHow does paint do it? White light contains all of the visible wavelengths. All paint has to do to direct red and blue light at your eye is remove green. Pigments don't radiate light of a certain color. Instead, they just absorb certain colors. Magents absorbs green. Cyan absorbs red. Yellow absorbs blue. \n\nBy the way, since you asked elsewhere in the thread, no-- if you zoom in you won't see bits of red and bits of blue. Magenta just removes green. An instrument called a spectrometer could tell what wavelengths are in the light [edit: you could see this too by directing magenta light at a prism or diffraction grating], but your eye just sees magenta.",

He was slender for a catcher, at 5' 9\" 160-lb.\n\nJorgens was purchased by the New York Yankees from Oklahoma City (Western) on August 24, 1928. His debut game with the New York Yankees was on April 26, 1929. Jorgens played his entire major league career with the Yankees serving as a backup catcher for Bill Dickey in eleven consecutive seasons. In 1934, he posted career-highs in hits (38), runs batted in (20) and games (58). He had a career-high .270 batting average in 1931. Jorgens was a career .238 hitter with four home runs and 89 RBI in 307 games. He has been one of only three Norwegian-born players to reach the major leagues. His final games with the New York Yankees was on August 2, 1939.\n\nJorgens died in Wilmette, Illinois, aged 74. He is buried in Memorial Park Cemetery, Skokie, Illinois.\n\nNotable achievements\nJorgens has the dubious distinction of having played on teams that won five pennants and five world championships (the New York Yankees in 1932, 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939), yet never making a single appearance in a World Series game. Over that period, the team's star catcher, (future Hall of Famer) Bill Dickey, played every inning of each World Series game.\n\nSee also\nList of Major League Baseball players who spent their entire career with one franchise\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nArt Jorgens New York Yankees Baseball card\nJorgens stats at Baseball Almanac\n\n1905 births\n1980 deaths\nPeople from Modum\nNorwegian emigrants to the United States\nNew York Yankees players\nMajor League Baseball catchers\nMajor League Baseball players from Norway\nRock Island Islanders players",

        "text":"When most people say virus these days they don't really mean a virus. They usually mean a worm, trojan, or other malware. I'll go over them 1 by 1, with a focus on thoroughness.\n\nA computer virus is a program that copies itself into another program. When you run a program with a virus, it looks for other programs on the computer, and inserts a copy of itself into the program. Some of them would have payloads, which would activate on certain dates, or if you ran an infected program 50 times, etc... The payload could do anything from making an ambulance drive across the screen, to overwriting your BIOS, which would make it so your computer wouldn't turn on. Back in the 80s and 90s, people would share things with each other using floppy disks. This meant an infected file could spread from one computer to another. They were also shared when people would upload them to a BBS, which was like a mini-internet for your local community. Later on, viruses were developed which ran in Microsoft Word files, which would spread from computer to computer as they were e-mailed around.\n\nA trojan is a program that claims to do 1 thing but secretly does something else you don't want. Those fake antivirus webpages which tell you your computer is infected would be a good example. If you download the program, it embeds itself deep in your operating system, which makes it hard to remove. Other trojans can even let someone at another computer have access to yours. What makes trojans different than viruses is that trojans don't spread by themselves, but they can be very similar.\n\nA worm is a program that spreads from computer to computer, rather than file to file. It spreads over networks like the internet, and when it gets on the computer it starts sending itself out again. Some worms e-mail people you know or hijack your Facebook. They will tell everyone to download a certain link or even send themselves as an attachment. Some other worms use bugs in a computer's operating system to break in and install themselves without the user clicking on anything.\n\nTrojans and worms are also use to form botnets. The trojan or worm will connect to another system and wait for commands. The botnet owner usually uses these computers, called zombies, to attack websites.\n\nAntivirus programs use signatures of these programs to stop them. Every program is unique. The antivirus makers find something unique in the virus\/trojan\/worm and when they scan a computer, they try to match all these signatures to any program on your system. They also check programs for signatures when you run them. The other method they use is heuristics. Every program is checked to see what it will do when you run it. The antivirus has a list of things a program can do which are suspicious.  These are things like automatically copying itself into your system folder, or trying to disguise what it's doing. If a program does too many suspicious things, the antivirus marks it. This is used to find viruses which may not have a signature yet. When a virus is found, the antivirus will remove it from the file (if it's a virus), or delete it (trojans\/worms).",

McKinney played Jason Stillwell in the 1986 martial arts film No Retreat, No Surrender.\n\nEarly years \nA native of Louisville, Kentucky, McKinney graduated from Ninth and O Christian School and attended the University of Louisville for one year. After that, he gained acting experience in local commercials and films while supporting himself by selling cars for Neil Huffman Dodge. Encouraged by people's comments, he left Louisville to go to Hollywood.\nHe began martial arts at the age of twelve, he started with Taekwondo, but later he trained Kickboxing.\n\nActing\n\nNo Retreat, No Surrender\nMcKinney's film debut came playing Jason Stillwell in 1985 martial arts film No Retreat, No Surrender, (Kurt McKinney was 22 years old when he did that movie) which also starred Jean-Claude Van Damme, J.W. Fails and Tai Chung Kim. The movie grossed $5 million at the US box office (and spawned two sequels). Although this success was moderate compared to similar movies of the time, such as the Rocky series, The Karate Kid series, or even The Last Dragon, it remains a cult classic film to many people around the world. 1987's No Retreat, No Surrender 2 was originally intended to be a direct sequel to this film, but safety concerns over filming in Cambodian jungles persuaded Van Damme to back out of the project, and he convinced McKinney to do the same.\n\nTV series\nEarly in his career, McKinney had guest starring roles on series such as Gimme a Break! (1985–86), Highway to Heaven (1987) and ALF (1986). He accepted his first contract role in a TV series. He appeared as the first Ned Ashton on the ABC soap opera General Hospital, from 1988 to 1991. In 1990, he won the Soap Opera Digest Award for \"Outstanding Male Newcomer: Daytime\" for his performance.\n\nFilms and Guiding Light\nAfter departing General Hospital, McKinney starred in the 1993 TV film Sworn to Vengeance and the unrelated 1996 feature Sworn to Justice.\n\nHis second contract role in a TV series was also his longest, appearing as Matt Reardon in the CBS soap opera Guiding Light from 1994 to 2000 and 2005 to 2009, when the series was canceled.\n\nDuring his first stint in Guiding Light he filmed a minor role in 1999 film Pop. McKinney left the soap in 2000 and continued to appear in minor roles in relatively obscure independent films, including 2000's Cupid & Kate, 2001's Supertalk, 2002's Bending All the Rules and 2004's Savage Faith.\n\nShortly before his return to Guiding Light in 2005, reprising the role of Matt Reardon, McKinney commented in an interview that he had been busy doing several independent films in recent years saying \"you'll probably never see which is unfortunately where so many of those end up.\"\n\nPersonal life\nMcKinney is married to Maronda McKinney, the former Maronda Buchta, whom he met when both were 18.They have a son, Cole Madsen, and a daughter, Madison Taylor.\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\nNo Retreat, No Surrender (1985)\nSworn to Justice (1996)\nPop (1999)\nBending All the Rules (2002)\nSavage Faith (2004)\n\nShort\nSupertalk (2001)\n\nTV movie\nSworn to Vengeance (1993)\nCupid & Cate (2000)\n\nTV series\nALF – 1 episode (1986)\nGeneral Hospital unknown episodes (1988 – 1991)\nGimme a Break! – 2 episodes (1985 – 1986)\nGuiding Light – unknown episodes (1994 – 2009)\nHighway to Heaven – 1 episode (1987)\nAs the World Turns – 14 episodes (2010) \nOne Life to Live – 2 episodes  (2011)\nBlue Bloods – 1 episode (2011)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAmerican male film actors\nAmerican male television actors\nAmerican male soap opera actors\nAmerican male taekwondo practitioners\nAmerican Jeet Kune Do practitioners\nAmerican wushu practitioners\nAmerican male kickboxers\nAmerican male karateka\nLiving people\nMale actors from Louisville, Kentucky\n20th-century American male actors\nYear of birth missing (living people)",

Some kids really like to be in sports and other things and they just can't help the fact that they don't know a subject very well. What if they only have one C? Are you really going to hold that against them? All because of one little C? I mean, a C isn't that bad. Kids make mistakes.  Some kids are strong in some subject, and some just cant quiet get there. Not everyone is good at one thing.  if they are struggling with a subject of two,\n\nyou should at least understand there predicament. A C average isn't that bad at all. Now if they were making D's and F's, then there's a problem. But a C? There's no harm against it. Besides, If half the school is making a C average, then who is going to be on that specific sports or team?\n\nWhat if all the people that are making an A or B average, are not interested in sports or other activity?\n\nWhat's the point of even having a sport at the school if no one is making a higher grade than a C? I know you want kids to succeed in life, but not everyone is perfect. Plus, being in an activity or sport can really help sharpen the brain. Remind kids once in a while to bring up there grade, but don't make a policy. It just isn't fair for everyone. I think kids that have a grade that is higher than a C, can be able to play in sports and be in an activity.",

        "text":"The difference between WWI and WWII, and the Seven Years' War is mass conscription\/mobilization and mechanization. These changes created wars that led to enormous loss of life and destruction, unlike anything in the past. Hence, you can understand why people previously called WWI the Great War or the war to end all wars. The 'democratization' of war, so to speak, really begins to take hold in the 19th century, after France notably employed the [*levée en masse*](_URL_1_) (basically large scale conscription of able bodied males) in the 1790s. Prior to this, war was relatively separate and disconnected from society, and not subject to popular political pressure--thus the demands on the population were smaller--which is why many states used mercenary forces to wage war in Europe prior to the 1800s. Literally, conflicts occurred with 10,000 Swiss troops battling 10,000 Swiss troops, each fighting for a different state. This means that, on par, war was less devastating since it was limited in scope and size.\n\nThe most direct answer to your question is that WWI was only named that later, and that the name is more a reflection of unprecedented destruction brought on by a geographically large conflict, which was compounded by the fact that mechanized warfare and large-scale mobilization of society, sometimes termed 'total war' (though this is a much more complex concept) created an unprecedented wave of destruction.\n\nEDIT: For a great book on how warfare changed over the centuries, see Charles Tilly, [*Coercion, capital, and European states, AD 990-1992*](_URL_0_)",

        "text":"CS and Math major here. I think a hash function explanation would be more useful here since hash tables are created from hash functions. So...\n\nYou have bunch of toys, each with a unique number between 0 and 99, inclusive. You have a list of these numbers, but they're in no particular order. Any time you want to find a toy, you need to look up its number in the list in order to find its actual location in your room. This usually works pretty well, but you want to make things faster because half the time you have to search through at least half the list, assuming you use all your toys equally (if you don't, this problem gets much more complex).\n\nThe problem you're trying to eliminate is having to do so much list searching. So, you devise a hash function. Let's assume that our hash function will take the number of the toy, divide it by 10, and return the whole number part, also known as the modulus operation (%). For example, if you give the hash function 24, it returns 2.\n\nNow that we have our hash function, we need to put it to use. Let's start by rearranging our big list of toys using our hash function. So, all toys numbered 0-9 will be put in a list 0 (because the hash function returns 0 for these toy numbers), all toys numbered 10-19 will be put in list 1, and so on. Let's think about what just happened. We had one list of 100 numbers. Now we have 10 lists of 10 numbers each, and we can instantly (as in without looking at other numbers or sub-lists) jump to the correct sub-list.\n\nSo, how does this hash function and updated list of lists help us? Let's try looking up toy number 45. If we do it the old way, it's entirely possible that we'll have to search a large portion of the list. If we use our hash function, we plug 45 into the function to get 4. Then we search sub-list 4. The toy is guaranteed to be in that sub-list because we plugged the whole list into the hash function earlier. Remember that sub-list 4 is only 10 numbers long, so the most numbers we'll have to search through is 10 as opposed to 100.\n\ntl;dr\nHash functions let you do the equivalent of \"I can very quickly figure out (without looking at any items in a list) what items in the list are similar to what I'm searching for, and then search this smaller list of items until I find what I'm looking for.\"",

        "text":"\nGood day, I am writing this letter to let you know it's time for things to change. I have been reading and researching the Electoral College and i have a strong opinion on it. As you know, the Electoral College is a process when all five hundred and thirty eight electors vote on electors and defenders.  This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our goverment! Our goverment should not allow or be based on \"the winner takes all\" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too!  Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The electors shouldnt be chosen by the canidate's political party, we should choose.  By voting for a president every four years a new party of electors have already been selected to run with him and we dont get any say.  After the presidential election, your governer creates a list of all the canidates that ran for president in your state with a list of their representative electors. This is later sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election  \nRichard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.  Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves  voters arent actually voting for the president, but for a group of electors who in turn elect the president,  How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?  As much as I hate to say it, there most definitley is an upside to the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because \"everybody is president\". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom. \n Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too ",

Practice relaxation--it is a learned skill for most people.;\n, Long, slow and focused breathing helps relaxation and takes attention away from pain.\n\n, Use intense stimulation (e.g., loud music) for temporary relief from pain.\n\n, Maintain contact with enjoyable people. Spend time interacting with pets (a dog or cat). Don’t allow your life to become a monotonous daily routine; do new and different things every day. Do things for other people. Learn something new every day.\n\n, Learn about these methods. Get training in self-hypnosis. Practice intense daydreaming. Go to a biofeedback therapist, get training, and buy your own equipment.\n\n\nMeditation is a particularly useful technique that has been shown to reduce pain. In fact, a study has shown that meditating for 20 minutes four times a day reduced pain intensity by 40%, and reduced the unpleasantness of the pain by a whopping 57% .\n\n, Take enough medication, often enough to control YOUR pain. Learn about analgesics (pain medications). Antidepressants should be considered by most chronic pain patients. Be careful about using tranquilizers--they are habit-forming and become less effective over time.\n\n, Acupuncture, massage, and electrical stimulation through a TENS unit are often helpful. Consult professionals who work in these procedures.\n\n, Ice can reduce pain for hours. You can also use ice on contra-lateral side of the body--that is, the opposite side of the body where the pain is experienced (ice the left hand, if you have intense pain in the right hand).\n\n, Don't suffer alone. Go to social events that you enjoy (music, church, political meetings); stay in contact with your family and friends (send everyone a positive email everyday).\n\n, Keep your life positive: surround yourself with positive ideas and people. Involve yourself in your religion if that it is important to you. Study psychology and learn about how the mind can be used to control feelings and perceptions.\n\n, Train yourself to be the best expert about your health. Learn about any disease that you have and stay current on treatment developments.\n\n, Don't indulge in excesses such as tobacco, too much alcohol or over-eating.\n\n, It may be very helpful to consult with a physician who specializes in pain management. If such a specialist is not available in your community, consult with an anesthesiologist. Also consult with a physical therapist, a health psychologist, or a nurse who specializes in pain treatment. Have you considered an acupuncturist or a practitioner of Chinese medicine? Supportive psychotherapy with a health psychologist is sometimes helpful.\n\n, Don't stay with the same practitioner if you feel they are discouraged and uninterested in helping you. Health providers are only human, each has their own personal limitations. Don't hesitate to ask for referrals to other experts. Some practitioners do not work well with chronic pain patients--don't let your practitioner get you into a negative thinking.\n\n,",

For several cats, you might need to do it about once a week.Instructions can provide a general guideline for how often to clean, but if you see evidence that the litter box is not working correctly, you should remove the old litter. If, for example, waste is being emptied out of the litter box on the floor, the waste basket is probably full.\n\n, You will occasionally need to clean the rake and electronic components of the litter box. When you do, unplug the box and use a wet rag and mild soap to wipe down everything. Do not try to submerge the litter box in water. This can cause it to malfunction. , Turn your litter box off and place a little bit of urine and\/or feces in it. Leave it there for about a day to signal to your cat what the litter box is for. If your cat does not respond, turn the litter box on and allow it to clean itself.Some cats prefer not to use a self-cleaning litter box, because they don’t like the sound that it makes when it cleans. However, some cats will get accustomed to it with time.\n\n, If you already have a litter box, place the two of them near each other. This will help your cat recognize what the litter box is for.Once your cat starts using the automatic litter box, you can start moving it slowly away from the other litter box every day. This will get them accustomed to going in a new location.\n\n, Self-cleaning litter boxes generally require a specific type of litter. Put a couple scoops of the litter from your automatic litter box in the original litter box. This will help your cat get accustomed to the new litter.If you can use your original litter in the new litter box, that is ideal, because your cat will already be accustomed to it.\n\n, Cats prefer to use a clean litter box. If you allow the other litter box to go uncleaned for a couple of days, your cat is more likely to use the automatic litter box.Try not to go too long without cleaning the litter box or your cat might decide to go elsewhere in your home. Two days without cleaning should give your cat a bit of a nudge toward the automatic litter box. More than that creates the risk of bad behavior.\n\n, Since many cats are deterred by the sound of the litter box cleaning, it can help if the litter box does not begin the cleaning process immediately after your cat steps out. On some models, you can set the timer on the litter box, so that it doesn’t begin cleaning until 20 minutes after your cat uses it.The timer will be located at a different spot on each model. However, it should usually be somewhere on the exterior of the litter box, where it will be easy to spot. Usually there will only be two or three settings and you will press a button to alternate between them.\n\n",

        "text":"Abner Nash (August 8, 1740December 2, 1786) was the second Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina between 1781 and 1782 and represented North Carolina in the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1786.\n\nLife story\nNash was born the son of Col. John Nash and Anne Owen at \"Templeton Manor\" Plantation in Prince Edward County in the Colony of Virginia. He read law and was admitted to the bar in Virginia. He also began his political career there, serving in the House of Burgesses from 1761 to 1765 before moving to New Bern, North Carolina. He married the widow of former colonial governor Arthur Dobbs.\n\nNash was an active supporter of the revolutionary cause. He represented New Bern in the rebel \"provincial congress\" assembled from 1774, and in 1776 was a member of the committee that drafted the state's new constitution. He became a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in 1777 (serving as the first Speaker of that house) and the North Carolina State Senate in 1779.\n\nHe was elected governor by the legislature in 1780. During his brief tenure as governor, North Carolina saw some of its worst conflicts as a battleground in the American Revolutionary War. Unlike his brother Francis, his temper and poor health were poorly suited to the needs of war. This brought him into difficulty with the legislature. The assembly appointed Richard Caswell as commander-in-chief (Major General) of the North Carolina militia and state troops, even though the constitution assigned this responsibility to the governor. Then in December 1780, they named a Council Extraordinary that further encroached on his office. Consequently, Nash resigned and went home in the spring of 1781.  Thomas Burke was named to replace him.\n\nDeath\nLater in 1782, North Carolina eased political tensions by sending Nash as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He would serve there the rest of his life, as he died at a session in New York City. Abner was initially buried in St. Paul's Churchyard in Manhattan, but his body was later returned for burial in a private, family plot in Craven County, North Carolina.\n\nFamily\nHis son, Frederick Nash, was also a lawyer and political leader. He would serve as Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Another descendant, Frederic, would later become a famous poet by his middle name, Ogden Nash.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBiographic sketch at US Congress website\n\n1740 births\n1786 deaths\nPeople from Prince Edward County, Virginia\nNorth Carolina state senators\nGovernors of North Carolina\nContinental Congressmen from North Carolina\n18th-century American politicians\nMembers of the North Carolina House of Representatives\nNorth Carolina militiamen in the American Revolution\nNorth Carolina state troops in the American Revolution\nPoliticians from New Bern, North Carolina\nAmerican lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law\nMembers of the North Carolina Provincial Congresses",

        "text":" Think about what sort of data is needed as input, how to structure the output, and include some intermediate output so you can monitor the progress of your calculation. This will be very useful if you know your calculation will run for a long time or involves multiple complicated steps.\n\n, Otherwise, you should do this:\n\n, Don't worry about all the minor details of the syntax, just become comfortable with compiling and running.\n\n,, Variables are where information is stored, functions and subroutines are pieces of code that can be executed, and arrays are groups of variables.\n\n, The \"IF\" statement will be one of your most frequently used statements, you can execute code based on whether a condition is true or not (e.g. whether the color the user provided was red).\n\n,,,, For example, the book \"Numerical Recipes in Fortran\" is both a good text on scientific programming algorithms and a good introduction to how to put together codes. More recent editions include chapters on how to program in a mixed-language environment and parallel programming. Another example is \"Modern Fortran in Practice\" written by Arjen Markus. The book gives an insight into how to write Fortran programs in twenty-first-century style in accordance with the latest Fortran standards., This is a relic from the past. In the early days of computer, there were no terminals. You entered data via punch-cards. A \"C\" in the first line on the punch card indicated a comment line. The next 4 spaces were reserved for line numbers and the 6th space indicated that the current line is a continuation of the previous line. This is needed because punch cards were only 80 characters wide. So, any line longer than 72 characters would be chopped off! Because of this legacy, lines of fortran are sometimes called \"Cards\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, For example, \"Hello, World\" could be written as\n\n\n ! HELLO.F90 -- HELLO WORLD PROGRAM\n ! PUBLIC DOMAIN\nPROGRAM HELLO\nWRITE (*, *) 'Hello, World!' ! Display 'Hello, World'\nEND PROGRAM\nFortran\n\n, Typically, this is done by issuing the commands (the > indicates the command line prompt)\n\n>f77 -c main.f\nand\n>f77 -c morestuff.f\nwhich generates the files: main.o and morestuff.o\nthen\nf77 -o killerap.x main.o morestuff.o\nwhich links main.o and morestuff.o to make your killerap.x. The -c and -o flags are pretty common...but you should read up on compilation flags for your particular compiler.;\n, However, most compilers include optimization algorithms that improve things even more. These are typically turned on by including a -O , -O2, or -O3 flag when compiling (again depending upon your version of fortran).\n\nGenerally, the lowest level -O or -O2 level is best. Be aware that using the more aggressive optimization option can introduce errors in complex codes and may even slow things down! TEST YOUR CODE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason.  Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason  Not to be on the electronics all day that would'nt be good at all compare that doing something all the time.  But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people would'nt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport.  one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it  What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too.  two everyone should do something in there lives should'nt be lazy because that would'nt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything  Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason.  three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity.  Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. won't have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time you'll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play.  Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life is'nt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment.",

        "text":"Short answer: as an average internet user your habits won't change.\n\nLike your 5:\n\nEveryone in your class signs up to get books form the library. There are all sorts of books, some cost some money some don't. Some are bad, some good and some are in between. \n\nEveryday you and everyone in your class writes down your name next to the books you want. Now this list means i know what book you and everyone else read. Normally at the end of the day the teacher puts the list in a file cabinet and she is the only one that knows what names have looked at which books.\n\nNow something bad happens and the principal wants to see the list. Before CISPA, there was a very specific list of reasons why he could ask for this list. On top of that he had to ask for specific names and or books on that list, and the teacher was obligated\/encouraged to not show him any part of the list that didn't have to do with the the bad thing that happened.\n\nWith CISPA, He can give a vague reason for wanting the list as long as he is sure to say the words \"school security\" and now the teacher has to give him the list.\n\nSo this doesn't seem all that bad, the principal just wants to see who took out the bad books and besides its for \"school security\" plus there's nothing that says that your teacher can't keep blocking the names that don't have anything to do with the original bad thing. BUT, now she is not obligated to hide that information, and the permanent markers she uses to blot out names is kinda pricey, so maybe she'll just give him the entire list. \n\nThis is worrisome because you just happened to have decided to check out some pg-13 material.You want to keep it private because as a student that should be your right. But now the principal, who happens to decide a whole bunch of stuff about what you get to do in school, plus he's friends with a bunch of people outside of school,r decide that they want to punish you for something else. Now they have the chance to use your honest reading habits against you.\n\nBut since you dont think about these things everyday,, and are generally a good kid who reads good books you won't change your reading habits\n\n**The Lesson; Dear Reader**: The principal has a lot of power already to get info, probably more than we are aware of, but at least right now there has to be at least a semblance of an iota of respect for a students privacy, CISPA is just one more chip at the block which can lead to a much bigger crack.",

Even though most red\ngalaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, and most blue galaxies are\ncurrently forming stars, there are significant populations of red star-forming\n(SF) and blue passive galaxies. This paper examines various properties of\ngalaxies belonging to the latter two categories.

Our analysis shows that\nthe blue passive galaxies have properties very similar to their SF\ncounterparts, except that their large range in EW(H_delta) indicates recent\ntruncation of star formation. The red SF galaxies fall into two broad\ncategories, one of them being massive galaxies in cluster cores dominated by an\nold stellar population, but with evidence of current star formation in the\ncore. For the remaining red SF galaxies it is evident from various metallicity\nmeasures and mean stellar ages, that their colours result from the predominance\nof a metal-rich stellar population. The implication of the properties of these\nSF galaxies on environmental studies, like that of the Butcher-Oemler effect,\nis discussed.\n",

        "text":"Büdingen is a town in the Wetteraukreis, in Hesse, Germany. It is mainly known for its well-preserved, heavily fortified medieval town wall and half-timbered houses.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\nBüdingen is in the south of the Wetterau below the Vogelsberg hills at an altitude of approx. 160 meters. The city is situated 15 km northwest of Gelnhausen and about 40 km east from Frankfurt am Main. Historically, the city belongs to Oberhessen.\n\nGeology\nBüdingen is situated in a wet and swampy valley. The castle and the old town therefore rest on centuries-old oak planks, placed horizontally across vertical beech piles (poles). The water level has to be kept high enough so that no air can reach these foundations.\n\nDistricts\nSince 1972, the municipality includes the following formerly independent villages: Aulendiebach, Büches, Büdingen (core or centre), Calbach, Diebach am Haag, Düdelsheim (the largest municipality), Dudenrod, Eckartshausen, Lorbach, Michelau, Orleshausen, Rinderbügen, Rohrbach, Vonhausen, Wolf, and Wolferborn.\n\nIn the same year, the district (Landkreis) of Büdingen was dissolved, and Büdingen and the district of Friedberg formed the Wetteraukreis, with Friedberg becoming the new district capital.\n\nHistory\n\nAround 700 the wooden church of Saint Remigius was built by an unknown lord. In 847 a \"Büdingen\" was named in a document for the first time, but it is not clear which Büdingen was meant, because there are some other smaller towns with the same name in Germany and Lorraine. An additional floor was added to St. Remigius's church in about 1050 and the building has basically remained unchanged since then.\n\nIn 1131 the House of Büdingen were mentioned for the first time. They became Burggrafen of Gelnhausen in 1155. The  (\"city\") of Büdingen was officially mentioned in 1206. The ruling House of Büdingen died out with Gerlach II before 1247.\n\nTheir heirs were the houses of Hohenlohe-Brauneck, of Isenburg-Kempenich, of Trimberg, of Hohenlohe and of Isenburg. On 26 July 1330, Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV granted the status of a market town to Luther of Büdingen.\n\nWith his edict of liberty in 1353, Burggraf Heinrich II granted freedom and some independence to the people of Büdingen. In return the people had to defend the city, so the Marksmen's Society was founded. This society still exists today as one of the oldest rifle associations in Germany.\n\nSince 1442 the masters of Büdingen have been known as Grafen of Isenburg-Büdingen. After a local war, Graf Ludwig II built an enormous new defensive wall with 22 towers around the old stronghold between 1480 and 1510. These walls are still nearly completely extant and they are one of the most important medieval fortifications in Germany.\n\nIn 1521, Martin Luther allegedly passed through. In the same year, the town became Protestant, later to become Calvinist.\n\nIn 1576, the Black Death killed many inhabitants, as it did again in 1632.\n\nIn 1590, a great fire destroyed many buildings.\n\nBetween 1633 and 1634 114 people were victims of witch hunting, although the first prosecutions took place in 1567. During the Thirty Years' War, in 1634, the town was taken by Imperial troops, who defeated the Swedish occupants.\n\nIn 1578 Emperor Rudolf II rewarded the Grafen\/Counts of Büdingen with the \"Jubilate\"-market (from the Latin word jubilate: \"to praise\"); an occasion for feasting. In 1806 the County of Ysenburg-Büdingen was annexed to the Principality of Isenburg-Birstein. After the Congress of Vienna, the Principality of Isenburg was divided in 1816 between the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt and the Electorate of Hessen; Büdingen went to Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1840, Graf Ernst Casimir III was promoted by a decree of the Grand Duke to the status of hereditary prince.\n\nIn 1601 Graf Wolfgang Ernst founded the Latin School, known today as the Wolfgang-Ernst-Gymnasium. In 1712 Graf Ernst Casimir I issued an edict of tolerance permitting religious dissenters to settle in Büdingen. As a result, by 1724 there was a suburb at the Lower Gate (Jerusalem Gate) where Huguenots, Waldensians, sectarians, and other separationists lived.\n\nIn 1822, administration and justice were split in the Grand-Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Büdingen became seat of the Büdingen counties lawcourt, which was followed in 1852 by the installation of the district of Büdingen. In 1839, the laborers' school (later called the trade school) was founded. The Mathildenhospital was built between 1867 and 1868. In 1879, a credit union (today the Volksbank), was founded. In 1936 Büdingen became a garrison town; U.S. troops were stationed there since 1945. The last American troops (1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment) departed Büdingen on 15 August 2007, ending 71 years of town history as a military garrison.\n\nMail service between Büdingen and Frankfurt am Main began in 1739: one mail coach and two mounted messengers a week. The Gießen–Gelnhausen railway, including Büdingen station was opened between Büdingen and Gelnhausen on 30 November 1870. In 1879 the new Gymnasium was built, including a gym and the principal's residence. Between 1888 and 1895 built a water main and began partial installation of a sewage system. The municipal gas works was established in 1910, and Büdingen received electric light in 1913.\n\nTrivia\n Büdingen was the home to the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (1-1 CAV), the Division Cavalry unit for the United States Army's 1st Armored Division.\n Büdingen was formerly the home to the 3rd Squadron, U.S. 12th Cavalry Regiment (3-12 CAV), the Division Cavalry unit for the United States Army's 3rd Armored Division from 1957 to 1989.

        "text":"There are two important facets of both Midway and Japanese air operations that need to be foregrounded for this answer. First, although Japan did lose four aircraft carriers at Midway, they did not lose them all at once. *Kido Butai* (the IJN carrier force) lost three carriers (*Akagi*,*Kaga*, and *Soryu*) in a series of dive-bombing attacks over the course of a few minutes at 1025. The fourth carrier, *Hiryu*, was unmolested and launched a counterattack against the USN. This  aggressive and somewhat foolish move guaranteed *Hiryu*'s later destruction during a USN counterstrike later that evening at 1700. The second point is that the majority of the *Kido Butai*'s  planes aloft at 1025 were the combat air patrol (CAP) A6M2s. These fighter planes were tasked with the defense of the Japanese fleet and had already given a decent account of themselves in decimating the USN torpedo attacks on *Kido Butai*. The general estimate from Jonathan Parshall and Antony Tully's *Shattered Sword* was that the IJN CAP at 1010 was thirty-six fighters which would soon be augmented to forty-two. \n\nWhat the above means for the OP's question was that there was plenty of time for a number of CAP fighters to land on the intact *Hiryu*. *Shattered Sword* estimates that *Hiryu* took on twenty-seven refugees, all of them fighters save for one strike aircraft straggler from the morning's attack on Midway atoll. This ensured that *Hiryu* had a fairly robust CAP through the evening but a somewhat anemic striking arm. \n\nThe fate of other sixteen CAP aircraft that did not land on *Hiryu* is a bit more murky. No doubt the USN shot down some of the fighters  and the aircraft went missing. Both USN fighter escorts and rear gunners did make claims of A6Ms and although such claims cannot be taken at face value due to the confusion of air combat, the USN undoubtedly did shoot down some of the Japanese CAP. *Soryu*'s fighter ace Fujita Iyozo had to bail out because of damage and he drifted in the water in his kapok lifevest  for some four hours until a spotter on the destroyer *Nowaki* sighted him. Some of CAP also ditched next to smaller Japanese ships like destroyers. This was a standard IJN practice and *Kido Butai*'s carriers usually had a destroyer detached as a plane guard on operations. A number of the damaged aircraft from the morning's strike on Midway ditched rather than try to make a landing. *Hiryu*'s post-1700 CAP of around fourteen A6M2s likewise ditched. There are records of nine fighters ditching and being rescued by surface ships, ironically none of the rescued crew were from *Hiryu*.   \n\nContrary to the popular historical memory that Midway devastated IJN aircrew, the IJN personnel losses from Midway were severe, but not catastrophic. Surviving manifests from *Kido Butai* show that only *Hiryu* and *Kaga*'s air groups suffered from massive losses among pilots and aircrew. IJN carrier doctrine was different than the USN in that pilots were seldom manning their planes until they had been spotted on the deck. While Fuchida Mitsuo relayed the tale of *Kido Butai* aircraft awaiting takeoff prior to the 1025 attack, this was a fabrication. Photographic evidence from the B-17 attacks two hours prior to the dive-bombing attack show nearly-empty flight decks and it would have taken a herculean effort for the Japanese to arm, fuel, and spot a strike package in that amount of time between the B-17 attacks and the 1025 dive-bombings. The 1025 bombings did extract a heavy toll among fitters and other maintenance personnel, which were losses the IJN found difficult to replace, but a good many of *Kido Butai*'s aviators were away from the conflagrations and escaped their carriers' fate. Some like Egusa Takashige were injured from the attacks, but others like Fujita were not. \n\nAgain, contrary to popular stereotypes, the IJN initially filtered the Midway survivors into training or instructor positions. The aggressive Fujita lamented this policy as it denuded frontline units of experienced personnel. The real problem was the material losses at the front outstripped Japan's ability to replace them, so many of these survivors had to be filtered back into combat, often as the replacement chiefs for other units. Fujita for example became *Hiyo*'s  divisional officer and Egusa went from leading dive bombers to commanding the 521 *Kokutai*, a shore-based unit of twin-engined Yokusuka P1Y1 strike aircraft, after his recovery. This was the general pattern for other Midway survivors in which they usually were promoted on the basis of experience to reconstituted or new units, but their experience could not make good on the growing qualitative and quantitative inferiority of Japanese airpower vs-à-vis the American enemy that was apparent by the end of 1942. The majority thus did not survive the war  even if they managed to survive the Midway debacle.",

        "text":"  I construct a near-IR star count map of the LMC and demonstrate, using the\nviewing angles derived in Paper I, that the LMC is intrinsically elongated. I\nargue that this is due to the tidal force from the Milky Way. The near-IR data\nfrom the 2MASS and DENIS surveys are used to create a star count map of RGB and\nAGB stars, which is interpreted through ellipse fitting. The radial number\ndensity profile is approximately exponential with a scale-length 1.3-1.5 kpc.\nHowever, there is an excess density at large radii that may be due to the tidal\neffect of the Milky Way. The position angle and ellipticity profile converge to\nPA_maj = 189.3 +\/- 1.4 degrees and epsilon = 0.199 +\/- 0.008 for r > 5 deg. At\nlarge radii there is a drift of the center of the star count contours towards\nthe near side of the plane, which can be undrestood as due to viewing\nperspective. The fact that PA_maj differes from the line of nodes position\nangle Theta = 122.5 +\/- 8.3 (cf. Paper I) indicates that the LMC disk is not\ncircular, but has an intrinsic ellipticity of 0.31. The LMC is elongated in the\ngeneral direction of the Galactic center, and is elongated perpendicular to the\nMagellanic Stream and the velocity vector of the LMC center of mass. This\nsuggests that the elongation of the LMC has been induced by the tidal force of\nthe Milky Way. The position angle of the line of nodes differs from the\nposition angle Theta_max of the line of maximum line of sight velocity\ngradient: Theta_max - Theta = 20-60 degrees. This could be due to: (a)\nstreaming along non-circular orbits in the elongated disk; (b) uncertainties in\nthe transverse motion of the LMC center of mass; (c) precession and nutation of\nthe LMC disk as it orbits the Milky Way (expected on theoretical grounds).\n[Abridged]\n",

The students have a chance to be creative and have fun with the project  It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.\n\nThey're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project. For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it.  It's something positive for students to do during the summer.  Kids are more likely to get into trouble whether it's because of boredom or they just like it them designing the project will give them something positive to do it'll keep them out of trouble and they'll have fun doing it. For example, one of the students i know likes to ride bikes everywhere even when he isn't allowed to and that gets him in a lot of trouble so one day i took him to the library and we read books and built action figures and he didn't get into any more trouble after that so sometimes all students need is something positive in their life and this project is just the thing they need.  The students will always be learning  Them designing their own project is an amazing idea because it gives them the chance to be responsible and make desisons on their own. They would have to use their brain to create and complete the project all by themselves. Just because school is out doesn't mean the students stop learning the summer is all about growing and maturing and them creating their own project is a great way to start. For example, one if my close friends won a price for one of her many great projects and she had to give a speech and in her speech she said \" This project has made more responsible and has taught me so much about myself and i hope i inspire everyone to go out and be creative.\"  This project is exactly what students need it helps them be creative, it gives them something positive to do, and they're always learning!

I would have to agree with you we are a very free and fair country for...most things like voting I would have to say that the Electoral Collage is the one unfair thing we have and their are many reasons why we should replace the Electoral Collage with popular vote.\n The Electoral Collage is when voting for the president, instead of dierectly voting you have electors represnt your state during elections. The Electoral Collage is made up of 538 electors, you have one elector for every member of the Congressional deleagtion and House of Representives plus two for the Sentors this is per state then they all come together to represnt during the election of the president. This is how the Electoral Collage is set up it all seems fair but you, yourself arent having a fair chance to vote for who you want as the president, its like haveing someone make your dessions for you its just unfair. The Electoral Collage is set up so the electors vote for who they want to win surely one of your electors will vote for who you want  but its not enough you basically have no voice during elections. Bradford Plumers The Indefsible Electoral Collage he says \"At the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters, because of the winner take all system in each state\" he then says \" The candidates only spend time in the swing states where they know they have a chance of winning\"; he is pointing out that those who are running for president spend a mojortity of their time in the states where they can get the most amount of votes for example they might campain to Florida or Washington DC but not even go to a state like Wyoming or Idoh.\n I think we should have the popular vote because it goves everyone a chance to vote for the president, they can voice their opions out loud and have a chance at seeing who they want in office. Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because the electors might all be Republican or all Democrat but we as voters dont get a chance to pick what party we stand for, with popular vote you have a chance to say who you want and what party you represent weather its Republican, Democrat or Induvial you at least get the chance and even though its only a 25 percent  chance who you vote for is going to win at least its still a chance. Popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can \"get to know\" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for. And yes they might spend a longer time in New york then Ohio but at least their spending time and educating the people on what they want to do and why the people should vote for them.  In Richard A Posners In Defense of the Electoral Collage he states that the Electoral Collage is good because of the \" swing states\" wich he then says \" The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election\" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for. Yes this might be true but what about all the non swing states like for example Texas they could have been careful while voting but Florida was not, then you have Ohio and New Mexico who could have been careful to but compared to Florida their votes get lost even though they were more careful and thoughtout.  So as you can see popular vote is more fair and also a smarter method of things it gives the peoplle a fair chance to vote for who they want while also allowing them to voice thier thoughts.    ",

        "text":"The Hessdalen lights are unidentified lights observed in a  stretch of the Hessdalen valley in rural central Norway.\n\nBackground \nThe Hessdalen lights are of unknown origin. They appear both by day and by night, and seem to float through and above the valley. They are usually bright white, yellow or red and can appear above and below the horizon. The duration of the phenomenon may be a few seconds to well over an hour. Sometimes the lights move with enormous speed; at other times they seem to sway slowly back and forth. On yet other occasions, they hover in mid‑air.\n\nUnusual lights have been reported in the region since at least the 1930s. Especially high activity occurred between December 1981 and mid-1984, during which the lights were observed 15–20 times per week, attracting many overnight tourists. , the number of observations had dwindled, with only 10 to 20 sightings yearly.\n\nSince 1983, \"Project Hessdalen\" initiated by UFO-Norge and UFO-Sverige have attempted to investigate the lights. This project was active as field investigations during 1983–1985. A group of students, engineers, and journalists collaborated as \"The Triangle Project\" in 1997–1998 and recorded the lights in a pyramid shape that bounced up and down. In 1998, the Hessdalen Automatic Measurement Station (Hessdalen ) was set up in the valley to register and record the appearance of lights.\n\nLater, a programme named EMBLA was initiated to bring together established scientists and students to researching the lights. Leading research institutions are Østfold University College (Norway) and the Italian National Research Council.\n\nHypotheses \nDespite ongoing research, there is no consensus for an explanation of the phenomenon. A number of potentially plausible theories have been put forward.\n\n There have been some sightings positively identified as misperceptions of astronomical bodies, aircraft, car headlights and mirages.\n\nOne explanation attributes the phenomenon to an incompletely understood combustion of airborne dust from mining in the area. The analysis identified hydrogen, oxygen and other elements including titanium.  It was thought this occurs in Hessdalen because of the large deposits of scandium there. The research led to the Norwegian press proclaiming that \"The Mystery in Hessdalen is Solved\". \n\n One recent hypothesis suggests that the lights are formed by a cluster of macroscopic Coulomb crystals in a plasma produced by the ionization of air and dust by alpha particles during radon decay in the dusty atmosphere. Several physical properties including oscillation, geometric structure, and light spectrum, observed in the Hessdalen lights might be explained through a dust plasma model. Radon decay produces alpha particles (responsible by helium emissions in  spectrum) and radioactive elements such as polonium. In 2004, Teodorani showed an occurrence where a higher level of radioactivity on rocks was detected near the area where a large light ball was reported. Computer simulations show that dust immersed in ionized gas can organize itself into double helixes like some occurrences of the Hessdalen lights; dusty plasmas may also form in this structure.\n\n Another hypothesis explains Hessdalen lights as a product of piezoelectricity generated under specific rock strains, because many crystal rocks in Hessdalen valley include quartz grains which produce an intense charge density.\n\nPiezoelectricity \n\nIn a 2011 paper, based on the dusty plasma theory of Hessdalen lights, Gerson Paiva and Carlton Taft suggested that piezoelectricity of quartz cannot explain a peculiar property assumed by the Hessdalen lights phenomenonthe presence of geometrical structures in its center. Paiva and Taft have shown a mechanism of light ball cluster formation in Hessdalen lights by nonlinear interaction of ion-acoustic and dusty-acoustic waves with low frequency geoelectromagnetic waves in dusty plasmas. The theoretical velocity of ejected light balls is about , in good agreement with the observed velocity of some ejected light balls, estimated at .\n\nThe central ball is white, while the ejected balls that are observed are always green in colour. This is ascribed to radiation pressure produced by the interaction between very low frequency electromagnetic waves (VLF) and atmospheric ions (present in the central white-coloured ball) through ion-acoustic waves. O ions (electronic transition ), with green emission lines, are probably the only ones transported by these waves. Electronic bands of O ions occur in auroral spectra.\n\nThe estimated temperature of Hessdalen lights is about . At this temperature, the rate coefficients of dissociative recombination will be  for the oxygen ions, and  for the nitrogen ions. Thus, in the Hessdalen lights plasma, the nitrogen ions will decompose  more rapidly than oxygen ions. Only ionic species are transported by ion acoustic waves. Therefore, oxygen ions will dominate in the ejected green light balls in Hessdalen lights, presenting a negative band of O with electronic transition  after ion-acoustic wave formation.\n\nPaiva and Taft presented a model for resolving the apparently contradictory spectrum observed in Hessdalen lights. The spectrum is nearly flat on the top with steep sides, due to the effect of optical thickness on the bremsstrahlung spectrum. At low frequencies self-absorption modifies the spectrum to follow the Rayleigh–Jeans part of the blackbody curve. Such a spectrum is typical of dense ionized gas. Additionally, the spectrum produced in the thermal bremsstrahlung process is flat up to a cutoff frequency, νcut, and falls off exponentially at higher frequencies. This sequence of events forms the typical spectrum of Hessdalen lights phenomenon when the atmosphere is clear, with no fog. According to the model, the spatial color distribution of luminous balls commonly observed in Hessdalen lights phenomenon is produced by electrons accelerated by electric fields during rapid fracture of piezoelectric rocks under the ground. In 2014, Jader Monari published a new HL model  involving a geological-like battery.  Thus, two sides of the valley are the electrodes and the river Hesja can be acting as the electrolyte. Gas bubbles rise into the air and can become electrically charged producing gas luminesce and HL phenomenon.\n\nSee also \n Aleya (Ghost light), Bengal\n Aurora\n Ball lightning\n Brown Mountain lights\n Chir Batti\n Hessdalen \n Longdendale lights\n Marfa lights\n Min Min light\n Naga fireballs\n Paulding Light\n St. Elmo's fire\n Will-o'-the-wisp\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Homepage of Project Hessdalen\n Project Hessdalen Bulletin, 1983–1985\n \n\nHoltålen\nAtmospheric ghost lights\nWeather lore\nUFO-related phenomena\nUnsolved problems in physics",

The motivation is to tackle the component collapsing and have a representation with stochastic dimensionality. To demonstrate the merit of their approach, the authors test this model on MNIST and SVHN in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion.\nAfter reading the paper in more detail, I find that the claim that the dimensionality of the latent variable is stochastic does not seem quite correct: all latent variables are \"used\" (which actually enable backpropagation) but the latent variables are parametrized differently (into $\\pi$) and the decoding process is altered as to give the impression of sparsity. The way all these latent variables are used does not involve any marginalization but is very similar to the common soft-gating mechanism already used in LSTM or attentional model.\nWith respect to the Figure 5b showing the decoder input weights: component collapsing probably does not have the same effect as Gaussian prior. $\\pi$ is positive therefore having a very small average value might mean that its value is close to zero most of the time, not requiring any update on the weight. For the standard Gaussian prior, component collapsing means having a very noisy input with no signal involved, which forces the decoder to shut down this channel, i.e. have small incoming weights from this collapsed variable.\nAdding a histogram of the latent variables in addition to that might help decide if the associated weights are relatively large because they are actually used or if it's because the inputs are zero anyway.\nThe semi-supervised results are better than a weaker version of the model used in (Kingma et al., 2014), but as to have a fairer comparison, the results should be compared with the M1+M2 model in that paper, even if that requires also using two VAEs.",

        "text":"Section 4 Continue:\nThe experiments in 4.5 are misleading and together with 4.4 they are contradictory to their theoretical results. \nForemost, the readers need to be aware that the decoders with switch units are very powerful (if you ever trained one you would know it too). Therefore what figure 4 presents is extremely misleading because it *only* takes the very last conv layer and use their proposed linear reconstruction algorithm to recover that layer’s input only.  The rest was propagated with the very powerful decoder plus switch units information (see [6] for how powerful the decoder is).  Visually, we can also see how much info switch units carry: for their conv 5 reconstruction with random activation, there is no meaningful info carried by the activation values but all through switch units and we can still obtain the silhouette of the objects in the original images; in fact, pool-1’s switch units alone carries at least 64x224x224 bit information. Their results back in the appendix (Figure5) also shows their reconstruction algorithm’s weakness. The lower layer has extremely bad reconstruction quality from the proposed algorithms. The higher the layer, the better the reconstruction from their proposed algorithms because decoder together switch units has more chance to correct the reconstruction.What the authors should do, is to use their IHT to reconstruct all the way, following what has been done in [1]’s linear reconstruction algorithm, which the authors here failed to compare against, despite its high relevance. In fact, the author of [1] used to be in charge of this submitted project and proposed this experimental approach, with a slightly different algorithm that is presented in [1]; but current authors of this submission failed in achieving similar reconstruction results with their algorithm and hence can only perform their reconstruction algorithm over a single layer. The biggest difference between the reconstruction algorithm from [1] and this submission is that the former used pseudo-inverse of the weight matrix and the latter used the transpose because in their theory, the weight matrix is approximate orthogonal hence its transpose is approximately its inverse.\n There is another serious issue with using high-up conv layer to verify their theoretical claim: recall that the excuse this submission used to discard ReLU non-linearity is that [1] introduced the pairing phenomenon, however, [1] stressed that it only appeared in the first few layers. Hence the authors should have at least chosen the first few layers for their experiments; yet, they knowingly only presented their analysis of the highest layer. \nTable 3 again presents very misleading results. First their “random activation” has a relative error 1.414 for activation space. But if we simply pick zero vectors instead of “random”, it gives 1 as a relative error, which is much smaller than 1.414. Therefore, this “relative error” in the activation space is a very inappropriate measurement for the reconstruction quality from their algorithm. But measuring the relative error in the input space is also a bad metric because of the powerful effects from the decoders. In fact, the term “relative error” is a paraphrase of the evaluation method used in [1], where it is called “reconstruction ratio”. However, it is a much more appropriate measurement coupling the reconstruction algorithm used in [1] because the reconstruction from [1] will always be a subset of the original input by using the pseudo-inverse.\n Recall that in 4.4, the authors approximate the conv weight matrix for conv(5,2) has approximately 0.05-0.1 distortion constant, which means that the “relative error” based on their Theorem 3.3 is 0.6-0.2, but in reality, the relative error is 1.051, which is not only worse than their theoretical guarantee but even worse than simply choosing zero vector as reconstruction. Keep in mind that these results are built on top of the assumption that ReLU does not exist, if we add it on top, these results in Table3 and Figure5 can get further downgraded. One question why there is such a huge gap. In fact, such bad reconstruction results based on their algorithm is not surprising because after all, unlike random weights, the learned conv weights are not approximately orthogonal so Model-RIP does not fit into realistic CNN models. In fact, the coherence is a very direct measurement of how “orthogonal” the learned weights are, which both this submission and [5] (again this submission took over [5]’s idea) measure this quantity: the higher the coherence the less orthogonal.  \n",

Nowadays, many public schools offer a special education program, but to many, the system might not exactly meet their requirements. Many handicap students need special transportation, seating, and feeding, which schools may not be able to provide. They also require alert attention at all times because anything could happen to cause them discomfort, pain, or even to fall down. Other students going through a health issue may find schooling at home to be rather more comfortable due to the same reasons. At home, the students will have their family members to look and care for them. Besides the staff not being able to properly handle students in need of altunitive care, the, \"regular,\" students attending the school can also be an issue. Kids of today are not the nicest and love tearing others down on their insecurities. Bullying could be a serious concern to many special education students.  Overall, one's health plays a huge role in one's schooling and place of schooling.  Along with students personal concerns, there are many problems that can arise at the homes of these students them to miss school.  School is one part of student's lives and some only have a limited amount of time they can put towards that one part. Many people struggle with family matters and are not always left out of them because they attend school. A student might be going to school everyday and as soon as they get home, they are taking care of another member in their family or cooking and cleaning. Many kids run their households because their parents are not in the right condition to act their part. This leads to students working and schooling. All those things take up a big portion of time and can cause much stress on the individual. Also, many times, students just fall ill out of nowhere, and are in such conditions where they have to stay home and rest. Having access to classes online and available to them at any given time reduces much burdens off their shoulders. No one really knows what goes on in student's lives outside of school, so the opportunity to attend classes should be permitted.  In conclusion, students would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home for many reasons. Their schedules, conditions, and personal reasons are all apart of this matter. If classes are not available to attend from home, many students will have lower grades due to concerns they can not help nor fix. Give students the right and privilege to do school work outside of the school building!  ",

        "text":"Update: I thank the authors for their comments! After reading them, I decided to increase the rating.\n\nThis paper proposes a variant of the convolution operation suitable for a broad class of graph structures. For each node in the graph, a set of neighbours is devised by means of random walk (the neighbours are ordered by the expected number of visits). As a result, the graph is transformed into a feature matrix resembling MATLAB’s\/Caffe’s im2col output. The convolution itself becomes a matrix multiplication. \n\nAlthough the proposed convolution variant seems reasonable, I’m not convinced by the empirical evaluation. The MNIST experiment looks especially suspicious. I don’t think that this dataset is appropriate for the demonstration purposes in this case. In order to make their method applicable to the data, the authors remove important structural information (relative locations of pixels) thus artificially increasing the difficulty of the task. At the same time, they are comparing their approach with regular CNNs and conclude that the former performs poorly (and does not even reach an acceptable accuracy for the particular dataset).\n\nI guess, to justify the presence of MNIST (or similar datasets) in the experimental section, the authors should modify their method to incorporate additional graph structure (e.g. relative locations of nodes) in cases when the relation between nodes cannot be fully described by a similarity matrix.\n\nI believe, in its current form, the paper is not yet ready for publication but may be later resubmitted to a workshop or another conference after the concern above is addressed.",

There are some accounts of Jews losing jobs during World War II. Music schools where Jewish performers taught were closed. On the whole, however, German advice and encouragement for the Japanese to establish anti-Jewish policies met with resistance from Japanese officials. Some of this reluctance may have been influenced by hopes of access to Jewish capital. Nevertheless, on December 31, 1940, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke told a group of Jewish businessmen, \"I am the man responsible for the alliance with Hitler, but nowhere have I promised that we would carry out his anti-Semitic policies in Japan. This is not simply my personal opinion, it is the opinion of Japan, and I have no compunction about announcing it to the world.\"\n\nSo it looks as though this was something the Japanese and Germans didn't see eye to eye about. \n\nThough [this](_URL_1_) from the Jewish Virtual Library on \"Japan  &  Jews During the Holocaust\" says \"The Japanese view of the Jews probably grew out of the complicated mixture of racism, nationalism, and fear of foreign conspiracy and secret control of international events that dominated Japanese national attitudes towards all foreigners, especially those living in western countries. Significant anti-Semitism first appeared in Japan after World War I and was probably part of the extremist, anti-Communist reaction against the Bolshevik Revolution that strongly emphasized the Jewish “nature” of the revolution, its ideology, and its leaders. With the signing of the GermanJapanese Anti-COMINTERN Pact in 1936 and the Tripartite Treaty of September 1940, anti-Semitism gained a more formal footing in some of Tokyo's ruling circles. Meanwhile, the Japanese public was exposed to a campaign of defamation that created a popular image known as the Yudayaka, or the \"Jewish peril.\"\"\n\nThe Wikipedia article on German-Japanese relations also says that \" The Holocaust was systematically concealed by the leadership in Tokyo, just as Japanese war crimes, e.g. the situation in China, were kept secret from the German public\".

The oscillation and following eruption were\nclearly seen in observations recorded by the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging\nTelescope onboard SOHO. The oscillation was seen only in a part of the\nfilament, and it appears to be a standing oscillation rather than a propagating\nwave.

We also identified the oscillation as a\n\"winking filament\" in the H-alpha images taken by the Flare Monitoring\nTelescope, and as a spatial displacement in 17 GHz microwave images from\nNobeyama Radio Heliograph (NoRH). The filament oscillation seems to be\ntriggered by magnetic reconnection between a filament barb and nearby emerging\nmagnetic flux as was evident from the MDI magnetogram observations. No flare\nwas observed to be associated with the onset of the oscillation. We also\ndiscuss possible implications of the oscillation as a diagnostic tool for the\neruption mechanisms.

        "text":"> Will the clock in space be different when we retrieve them, assuming the function of the clocks did not change because of the environment??\n\nYes. This actually happens and this must be corrected for during routine satellite communications.\n\nThe reason time dilation happens is that one *always* sees light moving at the same speed, regardless of how fast or slow he is traveling. Think about this for a second because it's whack as fuck (yes, this is how I talk to 5 year olds). If this rule applied to say, birds, then no matter how fast you were driving in your car you would ALWAYS see birds flying at the same speed relative to your car! You could be driving 1000 mph yet you will always see birds passing your car at the *same exact speed*. \n\nNow, let's pretend photons are birds and they ALWAYS fly at one speed. I will make a bird clock by putting a bird in a cage and making the bird fly up and down in the cage. One \"bird second\" is the time it takes the bird to fly up and down once. Now, if I have a bird clock and you have a bird clock and we are not moving with respect to one another everything is cool -- be both agree on how many times in one minute our birds fly up and down. \n\nBUT If I stand on a train, say, that moves with respect to you -- what do you see? You see my bird moving up and down, yes, but what you REALLY see is the bird moving up and down but also horizontally because of the motion of the train. You see my bird move in a ZIG ZAG like this! \n\n > \/ \\ \/ \\ \/ \\ \/ \\ \/\n\nNow, think about our crazy rule: we all see birds moving at the same speed *no matter what*! But, my bird is moving in a zig zag while yours is moving only up and down. To your eyes, it looks like my bird is moving  farther during one up\/down trip than yours. My bird looks like its doing: \/ \\ while your bird looks like it's doing: ||. In other words, you see my bird moving along a longer path than yours. If we must agree birds fly the same speed, then we must agree that you see my \"bird clock\" running slower than yours! \n\nIt's that simple! But some people find this hard to understand because it is *sooo strange* to think about birds flying only one speed relative to anyone who is watching them. But if you can understand this bird experiment, then you can understand time dilation because, in fact, photons behave exactly like these \"magic birds\"!\n\nEDIT: I should add that this time dilation is REAL so when the train slows down and I meet you back in the train station, my clock will indicate that it did run slower for a period of time. Likewise, if you jumped ONTO the train and met me there I would see your clock as having run slower for exactly the same reasons I have just described. Hope that helps!",

This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people.  Seeking multiple opinions can help because it can allow you to understand through different point of views,  It can help to get ideas on what you should do,  it allows people to understand where you're coming from.  They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member.  If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust.  Like if you were to need opinions on what color to paint your room, people would most likely give you different colors. Sometimes multiple people give you the same opinion when that occurs in a case like this, you'd usually go with whatever people think the most. For example, if six people said you should paint your room blue, and everybody else said different colors, you'd most likely paint it blue based of what peoples opinions were. Receiving opinions in this case is very beneficial to see what people think, and gather ideas  In conclusion, There are many ways seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinons help because, you can see things in different people's point of view, you can collect and gather peoples opinions and turn them into ideas, and it gives people a chance to show empathy, and be in your shoes.

A new timetable was introduced in October 2013 that realised the benefit of many of the projects, and by January 2014—the programme was complete.\n\nConception\nIn the mid-2000s, the Government of New South Wales suffered heavy criticism for its perceived mishandling of the Sydney rail network, which had very poor on-time performance following the January 2003 Waterfall train disaster. The safety regime introduced after this crash required drivers to stick to the speed limit, which often caused delays due to the expectations of the timetable for higher speeds. A slower timetable was introduced in September 2005, which significantly improving on-time running of services. The Clearways Programme was intended as the next step in improving the network.\n\nClearways routes\nThe Clearways Programme aimed to divide fourteen rail lines into five independent \"clearways\", reducing the heavily interwoven nature of the Sydney system. This was intended to isolate incidents to one part of the network so other lines would still run as scheduled. The \"clearways\" feed the existing lines through the Sydney Central Business District.\n\nAs the Carlingford Line does not run through the CBD, it was not included in a \"clearway\". Track upgrades to the Carlingford Line were still included in the programme, but this was cancelled in the November 2008 Mini-Budget. The Carlingford Line has since closed for Light Rail conversion.\n\nThe five clearways routes are:\n\nClearway 1: Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra\nThis route did not change from the pre-Clearways Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line. The projects undertaken on this route have increased passenger capacity.\n\nClearway 2: Bankstown\nAfter the Airport Line opened in May 2000, most trains from the East Hills line used the new line to approach the city, easing congestion on the older line between Sydenham and Erskineville, where tracks are shared with Bankstown Line services. Under the programme, new dedicated tracks for the Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Erskineville were to be constructed to the west of the existing four tracks to allow express East Hills Line trains from Clearway 3 to again run via Sydenham. The Airport Line would be served by all-stops East Hills Line trains from Clearway 4.\n\nSt. Peters and Erskineville railway stations were expected to continue to be served by the Bankstown Line. This would have required platforms—partially completed in the 1970s from the Eastern Suburbs Line construction—to have been activated at these two stations. The works were cancelled in November 2008, and the plan for frequent operation of express East Hills Line services via Sydenham was abandoned.\n\nA second Bankstown Line project involved the construction of a new turn-back platform at Lidcombe, separating the Bankstown Line's operations from the former Inner West Line (later part of the Airport, Inner West & South Line). This works in concert with the Homebush turn-back project, which provides a terminating point for all stations trains on the Airport, Inner West & South Line. This separation was enacted in the October 2013 timetable. The turn-back platform at Lidcombe was also marked in 2012 as a terminal for Sydney Metro Southwest, with original plans to convert the Bankstown Line through to Lidcombe and Cabramatta into rapid transit. This plan has since been altered to have Bankstown as the terminus of the Metro line.\n\nClearway 3: Campbelltown Express and Clearway 4: Airport & South\nThe Campbelltown Express Clearway would have separated the section of the East Hills Line east of Revesby by quadruplicating between Kingsgrove and Revesby and sending express trains to the City Circle via Sydenham. This was to allow more frequent express services to the city, relieve pressure on other parts of the network and improve the distribution of passengers.\n\nOn the Airport & South Clearway, express services would have begun at Glenfield and made their way through Liverpool, Cabramatta, Granville, Lidcombe and Strathfield stations to the City Circle, while all-stations services to the City started at Homebush. After passing through the City Circle, trains would have headed south-west via the Airport Line to Revesby (running parallel with the Campbelltown Express line from Wolli Creek to Revesby).\n\nIn the October 2013 timetable, these two clearways were merged to create the Airport, Inner West & South Line. Differences from the original plan include via-Revesby and via-Granville trains sharing tracks between Glenfield and Macarthur, and all-stations and express trains via-Revesby sharing tracks between Revesby and Central. Most trains from Macarthur via Revesby use the local (pre-existing) tracks between Revesby and Wolli Creek, and make a number of stops along the route. These trains approach the City via the Airport. The route via-Sydenham and the express tracks between Wolli Creek and Revesby are only used by a limited number of peak-hour services as well as NSW Trains services to Goulburn, Canberra, Griffith and Melbourne.\n\nIn the November 2017 timetable, in addition to peak-hour trains from Macarthur via Sydenham utilising the express tracks between Wolli Creek and Revesby, most Macarthur via Airport services throughout the day now operate via the express tracks, resulting in the full separation of Macarthur express trains from Revesby all-stations trains which continue to use the local tracks. This has resulted in the removal of express trains for Padstow and Riverwood as the express tracks are unable to serve those stations where there are no platforms.\n\nClearway 5: North West\nThe North West Clearway provides an independent corridor for the North Shore & Western Line and Northern Line to improve reliability and capacity. Trains from the west start from the Richmond, Penrith or Epping branches, meet up at Strathfield and travel through the city to Chatswood. Here trains used to split, either continuing up the North Shore Line to Berowra, or via the Chatswood to Epping Line to Hornsby, prior to its conversion to Sydney Metro Northwest in 2018.\n\nProjects\nMany infrastructure upgrades needed to be completed in order to implement the Clearways plan. These projects included upgrading stations, adding extra tracks, stabling facilities, or upgrading junctions.\nThe projects were:\n\n[{\n\"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n\"service\": \"page\",\n\"title\": \"Sydney suburban passenger rail network (2009-15).map\"\n},\n{\n\"type\": \"ExternalData\",\n\"service\": \"page\",\n\"title\": \"Rail Clearways program.map\"\n}]\n\nNon-clearways projects\nOther projects of the era which were not part of the Rail Clearways programme:\nEpping to Chatswood railway line – opened February 2009\nSouthern Sydney Freight Line by the Australian Rail Track Corporation – gives freight services their own dedicated line through southern Sydney – opened January 2013\nSouth West Rail Link – includes an additional platform at Glenfield and a flyover at Glenfield North Junction – opened February 2015\nNorthern Sydney Freight Corridor – a series of projects to increase capacity for freight services – completed June 2016\n\nResignalling:\nSefton – completed January 2006\nOatley – Cronulla – completed April 2010\nNorth Sydney – St Leonards\n\nCancelled projects included:\nRedfern to Chatswood line – announced in 2005, cancelled in 2008\nCBD Relief Line – announced in 2010, cancelled in 2011\n\nSee also\n Transport in Sydney in the 2010s\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFlickr gallery showing construction of Rail Clearways projects\n\nRail infrastructure in New South Wales\nRailway lines in Sydney\nSydney Trains",

        "text":"Would you rather be a cockroach or an ant? This isn't in a size match up but a living condition. A lone ranger roach or a society of workers like the ants. The same aspect can be applied to when people ask if offering classes at home would be beneficial for students. Students that would take classes at home would be enclosed away from peers and friends, while a student at school would be surrounded by peers and many people alike.  So to a small extent students would benefit from being able to attend class from home, because this would let them learn at their own pace as well as in their best learning technique.  However, to a greater extent students would be at a loss from taking classes at home,  they would lose their social interaction  challenges brought on by the environment of schools.  Education is about efficiently farming the minds of youth to grow great minds. Without the challenge of competing peers and uncomfortable situations for students the techniques would be less effective. To begin there is evidence to support that students in unfamiliar habitats like a school test better than students that are familiar with their testing environment. So students learning from home would test worse than students at school just due to the simple fact that they are more relaxed in their environment. Continuing, in schools peers push the learning potential upon themselves because of the social hierarchy with grade status. This is a key element with having a generalized system, this system creates competition among students to be at the top.  The ability to take classes at home would hinder the students inner strength by proposing no challenge for them.  If you never went to school or work, how many friends would you have?  Students offered classes at home would have minimal social life due in part to the lack of social interaction with the people in their area.  Students make life long friends from school: college roommates, kindergarten best friend, or high school sweethearts. Taking away the random dice roll of interactions by lowering the rate at which kids interact would create students with minimal social lives and students more likely to become sad or depressed. Students taking classes from home would loose touch with societal standards and become worse adults by not respecting things like: dress codes, rules of the office, or authority figures. This would be because of the lowered interaction with these rules and could lead to people who aren't mentally tough. Students without friends would become lost in society and could be unable to speak about their situation because of their lack of original social interaction. \n Students taking online classes could have the ability to learn better, this is because they could learn at their own rate and they could learn with their best suited technique.  Students aren't all the same, and having one technique used on all can hinder some of their abilities. Students taking online classes could use outside resources for study and this could create the situation best suited for their learning style. This could lead to better retention of the knowledge and a greater understanding of the material. Students could take the course at their speed, this could mean some would finish faster than others, but the main argument in this is students would have better material retention because they would be in the mindset of learning and not just going through the motions of school. Online school has its niche benefits for its population of students willing to take the toll. \n To conclude students are better off taking classes at school, but there is a small population of students that taking online classes could work better for. Students would have to test out the options first and see what works best. Because even though online school sounds good on paper, it could very well be horrid in practice. Students always want to find the easy way out, and online school could be that no challenge road. That would lead to a greater number of students failing out of rigorous courses, and a potential of uneducated students because of a lower retention of material. Overall students should stay in school because it would create the fun challenging environment and a better social understanding for students. ",

For example you may have heard of super conductors, which are super cooled.  That's because the electricity flows across metal easier when it's colder.\n\nSemi-Conductors stop being semi-conductors outside of acceptable ranges.

        "text":" A settlement agreement is a legally enforceable contract.They can be used in a variety of situations where two parties are in dispute about something and they wish to compromise on how that dispute will be resolved.A settlement agreement will act as a \"release,\" which means that in exchange for some act (often the payment of money), one person will give up their legal claim against another person.For example, if your garage is damaged when your neighbor backs into it with their car, you might agree to settle this dispute and release your neighbor from any legal liability if he or she agrees to pay for the repairs to your garage.\nSome of the most common situations in which a settlement agreement is utilized include: disputes over damaged property; employment disputes between employers and employees; marriage disputes; and medical malpractice disputes.;\n, You will need to decide if you have the legal capacity to enter into a valid contract, which involves knowing what you are getting yourself into by entering into the agreement.A settlement agreement should be in writing.Also, you will want to know what is needed to create a legally binding contract. Those requirements include:\n\n\nAn offer. This is what one party proposes to do, pay, etc.Acceptance. This is the willingness to be bound by the terms of the offer.Valid consideration. This is something of value that the promisor receives from the promisee in return for the promise. It can be tangible or any type of benefit.For example, if you offer to sell your car to your brother for $4000 and he accepts, the $4000 is the consideration. To be valid, consideration must be reasonable and agreed on by both parties without coercion.\nMutual assent. Both parties must accept the offer without being forced to do so by coercion or any other means.For example, if you agreed to give a robber all of your money so that he does not shoot you, there is no mutual assent even though there is an offer and acceptance.\nA legal purpose.A settlement agreement must also not be \"unconscionable.\" This means that it cannot be illegal, fraudulent, or criminal. For example, you could not agree to settle a lawsuit in exchange for six pounds of cocaine, because the sale of cocaine is illegal in the United States., If you are unable to determine whether your contractual provisions will comply with state law, you may want to consider hiring or consulting an attorney.\n\n\nIn general, any contract lawyer or lawyer practicing in the field your dispute arises in (e.g., property law, tort law, family law) will be able to help you determine if your settlement agreement is likely to be valid.\n\n, Both parties are likely to have a differing view of the dispute. Before writing your settlement agreement, you must come to an agreement of the factual terms of the dispute.A mediator may be helpful in determining this., The consideration is what one party is going to receive in return for giving up any possible legal remedy. You will also want to determine how the compensation will be turned over (i.e., all at once or over time).For example, payment arrangements and logistics should be hammered out before you write the settlement agreement.\n\n, This is likely to be a point of contention in some settlement agreements. Some parties will be willing to settle only if they do not have to admit to liability or wrongdoing. This is very common in corporate settlements.For example, if you are agreeing to settle with a corporation whose hair dye turned your hair green and made it fall out, the corporation could agree to the settlement agreement as long as the settlement is not construed as admission of fault or wrongdoing on their part.\n\n, Sometimes, a conditional settlement agreement may be desirable. For example, this is the case where an action must be performed in order to resolve the issue, but that action will take time to complete. It is not usually desirable in situations where something may not be completed by a certain date, such as keeping a trade secret confidential.In this case, you should negotiate an unconditional settlement agreement, which takes effect after a certain number of days., You must negotiate the scope of the release in the agreement to determine which claims will be resolved, and whether any future claims are also resolved by this settlement agreement. You can negotiate a provision stating that the settlement agreement applies to all claims arising out of the dispute, whether they are current or not yet realized, or the settlement may resolve just one aspect of a suit or a single claim. This will depend on your needs., Begin your settlement agreement by titling the document in a way that informs the reader about what the agreement is.\n\n\nDepending on the case, it may also require a caption or style of the case to be added. For example, if it is part of ongoing litigation, it may need to include the names or identifiers of all plaintiffs, and this information could change as the case develops., You should write a paragraph that introduces the parties to the agreement (who is involved in it) and defines their roles. You should include names and addresses, as well as a statement that the parties named have the capacity and authority to enter the agreement.The statement may also state that the parties named have the capacity to bind a company or entity, if this applies. For example, if your settlement agreement is with a small business, the small business owner could agree to serve as the binder for his company.\nFor example, a common introductory paragraph looks like this: \"This Settlement Agreement and Release (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of by and between (a) (“DEFINE PARTY A”) and (b) (“DEFINE PARTY B”). Collectively, and shall be referred to as the “Parties”.\"When you define the parties, you will describe one party as the one being released from legal liability, and you will describe the other party as the one granting the release., In this section you will need to describe the \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of the dispute.It is important to do this so both parties are in agreement about what specific act is being discussed in the agreement and what is being settled. Without this provision, a court will have a tough time upholding and enforcing your settlement agreement in the event it is breached or you have to get it approved.\n\n\nIf you are settling a medical malpractice dispute, you may write a scenario that explains: who the patient was and who the doctor or doctors were; what happened that caused the dispute, (e.g., the doctor left a sponge in the patient's abdomen after the surgery); when the dispute occurred, (e.g., on March 5, 2014 at approximately 12:15 p.m. while the patient was in surgery); where the dispute occurred (e.g., at the doctor's office, located at a certain address); and how the dispute occurred (e.g., the doctor was not paying attention and forgot about the sponge and the patient found out when they started having pains in their side).\nBe as detailed as possible and include any information you may think is relevant to the agreement you are creating.\n\n, This section will include the required consideration, which is necessary to spell out in order to have a valid contract.The type of payments that can be contracted for are wide-ranging and will depend on what the dispute was that led to the settlement agreement you are creating. Compensation could be in the form of money, repairs, replacements, or even promises. Compensation cannot be anything illegal, fraudulent, or criminal.\nIf you are entering into a settlement agreement as a result of property damage, your provision may state: \"Party A agrees to release Party B from liability so long as Party B compensates Party A in the form of $500 in order to repair the broken fence.\" Also, instead of including a dollar amount, the provision may state that Party B will be required to repair the broken fence his or herself in order to be released from liability.\nIf you are executing a settlement agreement as a result of something like trespassing, you may include a provision stating Party A agrees to release Party B from liability so long as Party B never trespasses again. You may then include a sentence stating that if Party B does trespass again, the settlement agreement will be null and void and Party A will be free to pursue legal action.\nWhen you are drafting this provision, be sure you are confident in the consideration you are receiving or giving up. Settlements are legally binding contracts and you will likely be stuck with the compensation you agreed to, even if you find out later it is grossly inadequate or extremely over the top. For example, if you agree to compensate someone $500 for the damage you caused to their vehicle, and they later find out the actual cost of repair was $5,000, they will likely be stuck with the $500 you provided and they will not be able to collect more., During negotiations, you should have determined with the other party whether the settlement agreement will resolve all claims, including unknown and future claims, or whether it will cover only a certain claim. In general, it is advisable to resolve all claims, including unknown and future claims, with your settlement agreement.You should look to include a provision that looks something like this: \"Claimant and Employer hereby mutually release and forever discharge each other and each of their affiliates, subsidiaries, parent corporations and their respective agents, present and former directors, officers, executives, employees, predecessors and\/or successors in interest, attorneys, heirs and assigns, from any and all matters, claims, complaints, charges, demands, damages, causes of action, debts, liabilities, controversies, judgments and suits of every kind and nature whatsoever, arising out of the same subject matter or occurrence as this claim\/cause of action, as of the date of this Agreement, foreseen or unforeseen, known or unknown, including but not limited to, those arising out of Claimant’s employment with Employer and, if applicable, the termination of such employment.\"This specific clause is tailored to an employment dispute, but you can change the wording and the parties in order to make it fit your needs.\nNot all settlements will resolve any and all claims arising from the dispute. Make sure to negotiate a clear statement of scope.\n\n, Sometimes, a conditional settlement agreement may be desirable. For example, this is the case where an action must be performed in order to resolve the issue, but that action will take time to complete. It is not usually desirable in situations where something may not be completed by a certain date, such as keeping a trade secret confidential.In this case, you should negotiate an unconditional settlement agreement, which takes effect after a certain number of days.For example, if a contractor you hired ruined your attic through faulty building, a settlement agreement could negotiate your waiving your right to sue conditional on the contractor replacing the attic at no cost and passing a building inspection within one month. If the condition is not met, the settlement agreement is nullified.\nYou might want to include language such as the following: \"All Parties agree and understand that this agreement on behalf of is subject to approval of the conditions stipulated herein before it can be binding upon the . Counsel for the Parties agree that they will recommend to approve this agreement and will make his\/her best effort to secure that approval and to secure that approval at the earliest reasonable date.\"Then you would spell out the exact conditions that will satisfy the agreement.\n\n, Oftentimes, when parties are agreeing to settle a dispute through a mutual agreement as opposed to going through the judicial process, the party providing the settlement payment will not want to admit any liability or fault. If you have previously negotiated this, provide a clause, like the one below, that allows the party in the wrong to compensate the other party without having to admit any wrongdoing.\n\n\nIf you plan on including a provision agreeing that the settlement will not include any admissions of fault or liability, you may want to use the following language: \"The Parties acknowledge that the Settlement Payment was agreed upon as a compromise and final settlement of disputed claims and that payment of the Settlement Payment is not, and may not be construed as, an admission of liability by and is not to be construed as an admission that engaged in any wrongful, tortious or unlawful activity. specifically disclaims and denies (a) any liability to and (b) engaging in any wrongful, tortious or unlawful activity.\", Making your settlement agreement confidential ensures that neither party can discuss or reveal any of the terms of the settlement to the world.This type of provision comes up most in business settlements where one company is often involved in litigation and settlement, and does not want other potential litigants to know the usual terms of their agreements. It may also come up in medical settlements where a doctor wants to restrict the patient's ability to reveal what happened and how much the doctor paid out.\n\n\nIf you wish to include a confidentiality provision, it may look like this: \"The terms and conditions of this Agreement are absolutely confidential between the parties and shall not be disclosed to anyone else, except as shall be required by law. Any disclosure in violation of this section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.\", If you are in the middle of litigation when you decide to settle and create a settlement agreement, be sure you include a provision ensuring that both parties will dismiss the litigation and not move forward with it.\n\n\nIf you are in this situation, consider using this language: \"and his\/her\/its counsel shall take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the Litigation is dismissed in its entirety as to all defendants named therein, with prejudice and without costs or fees, within days of his\/her\/its\/their receipt of the Settlement Payment. will cooperate with in securing the dismissal of the Litigation as appropriate.\"It is highly advisable to have your settlement agreement approved by the court. This constitutes a court order, which is far easier to enforce than a simple contract. Especially if you are not certain whether the other party will abide by the terms of your agreement, you should present the settlement agreement to the court for approval., Towards the end of your contract you will include any standard provisions that are usually found in contracts. Most of these provisions you can simply take from a form contract you find, but make sure you read over them and ensure they say what you want them to. Some of these provisions may include:\n\n\nSeverability provisions;\nModification provisions;\nIndemnification provisions;\nChoice of law provisions; and\nEntire agreement provisions.\n\n, At the very end of the contract you will make space for all parties to sign the contract. This area should have spaces for your signatures and dates.\n\n, Once you have written your settlement agreement you will offer it to the other party. Assuming that your negotiation process went smoothly, both parties should be satisfied. However, the other party has several options once presented with the agreement:\n\n\nThe other party may accept the offer in full. In this instance, you will then sign the contract and start performing.\nThe other party could reject the offer in full. If this is the case, you will have to write a more acceptable settlement agreement or go to court. If you have already been through negotiation, this is unlikely.\nThe other party might try to negotiate some of the terms of your settlement agreement. If this happens, you will negotiate with the other party until you both reach an acceptable agreement. You may have to make minor changes to wording or terms to satisfy both parties.\n\n, If your settlement agreement is part of litigation (i.e., you have been in court and maybe the judge asked you to try to negotiate a settlement), you may be required to present your settlement agreement to the judge in order to have him or her sign off on it.Even if you are not required to get a court's approval, you may want to think about doing so, if it is a possible option, because a court order is much easier to enforce than a contract.This option may not be possible if you are settling a dispute outside of the judicial process., When you and the other party are satisfied with the document, you will both sign it and begin performance in the manner you both agreed upon.\n\n",

        "text":"Shyama Charan Gupta (9 February 1945 – 9 April 2021) was an Indian politician from the Bharatiya Janata Party, entrepreneur, and Member of Parliament representing Allahabad (Lok Sabha constituency) in the North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He was the founder of Shyama Group of companies, established in 1973.\n\nEarly life and education \n\nShyama Charan Gupta was born in Unchadih, District Chitrakoot (Uttar Pradesh) on February 9, 1945. He was educated in a nearby village Manikpur till High School, completed Intermediate from Allahabad. His academic qualifications include B.A, LL.B. from Kanpur and Lucknow subsequently.\n\nPolitical career \nShyama Charan Gupta contested the parliamentary elections for the first time from Banda as an Independent candidate in 1984 and came third. His second parliamentary election was from Allahabad in 1991 on BJP ticket. He lost to Janata Dal's Saroj Dubey by 5,196 votes. In 1996, he campaigned for Murli Manohar Joshi only to challenge him in 1998 Lok Sabha elections as Samajwadi Party candidate. After losing the poll, he shifted to Banda (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1999 general elections. On 28 August 1989, he was elected as Mayor of Allahabad. He was elected the Mayor of Allahabad after a gap of 19 years, it was a prestigious election which he won as an independent candidate with the support of then Janta Dal. He emerged as a solid and a powerful Baniya Leader of Eastern UP during that time. In 2004, Shyama Charan was elected to the 14th Lok Sabha from Banda parliamentary constituency on the ticket of Samajwadi Party. He unsuccessfully fought from Phulpur in 2009 general election, losing to his Bahujan Samaj Party rival by a margin of less than 15,000 votes.

        "text":" Unfortunately, even though substance addiction is a medical and mental health condition, it is still the subject of immense social stigma. Many people use language that dehumanizes people who are addicted to substances, such as calling them \"drug addicts,\" \"smack-heads,\" \"dirty,\" or similar. This language increases the stigma surrounding addiction and will not help your loved one. Addiction is a highly complex phenomenon that is not entirely within a person's control. Do not define a person by her disorder.Always use language such as \"a person addicted to drugs\" instead of things like \"drug addict.\"\nWhen you speak with the person, always frame her addiction as something she has, not something she is. For example: \"I'm worried that your drug use is harming you\" is appropriate. \"I'm worried that you're a junkie\" is not.\nAvoid using words such as \"clean\" to express being drug-free and \"dirty\" to express using drugs. These further the stigma and can increase your loved one's sense of shame about her addiction, which could lead to further drug use.;\n, A qualified counselor who specializes in addiction can help you and other friends or family consider your options when it comes to dealing with a person addicted to drugs. Counselors are objective third-parties who have little personal stake and so can provide a much-needed outside and rational voice. In addition, counselors are trained to provide empathy, support and encouragement, which may be hard to get from other people who are concerned about the person and are too inside the situation to see clearly -- which could include you. Try to find a counselor in your area or consider consulting your primary care physician for recommendations.\n\n\nAlternatively, if therapy is not a good option for you, you can attend Nar-Anon meetings, which are designed to be safe spaces for the families and friends of people addicted to drugs.A substance abuse professional may also be able to provide guidance on how to help the person. Be prepared to provide detail about how often the person uses heroin and how much, whether she uses any other drugs, the duration of the addiction, symptoms and behavioral patterns and the like.For more information on drug addiction in general, consult the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration or the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n, Make an attempt to talk to the person about your concerns about her drug use. Make sure the person is not using when you have this conversation; if the person is using or has recently used heroin when you try to have this conversation, try again later. Avoid blaming, preaching, lecturing, and moralizing and instead tell the person plainly about your worries.Come ready to offer specific instances of the problem behavior that has you concerned. Bring up past incidents, such as \"When you cancelled our plans last week...\" instead of \"You always break your promises.\" Use \"I\" phrases, such as \"I noticed\" or \"I'm worried,\" since these sound less blaming and are less likely to place your loved one on the defensive.Focus on the effects of the person's heroin addiction on the things she cares about the most, whether that be career, friends, children, parents, etc. This may help the person realize her actions do not only affect her.You can also conduct an intervention, a professionally directed process in which the person addicted to heroin meets with friends, family, employers, etc. An intervention can be helpful because it can aid the person in connecting her drug problem to the problems in her life. Ninety percent of interventions done with a trained interventionist result in the addicted person making a commitment to get help. Contact your local National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) for more guidance.\n\n, Upon learning about the person's addiction, your first reaction might be to convince her to stop by threatening, pleading or begging. This won't work – heroin is too strong an influence over the person's life for her to be able to stop just because you want her to. Heroin users will only stop when they are ready to. Although it might be tempting to launch heavy-handed threats, this isn't actually feasible and won't help her unlearn the behavior and treat the triggers that have led her to use heroin.\n\n\nKeep in mind that emotional appeals could backfire in that they may only make the person feel guilty and engage in further substance abuse.\nSometimes an individual with a long-term addiction will have to hit 'rock bottom' (a personal low point in one's life marked by desperation and hopelessness or a major occurrence such as an arrest) before the person decides to quit. However, most people do not need to bottom out to want to get help., How you talk to the person will depend on her relationship to you. Is the person a family member, good friend, or co-worker? Consider writing down how you want to open the conversation in advance to mentally prepare yourself. Here are some potential \"opening lines\" that can help you approach the person in the appropriate manner:Helping a family member - \"Mom, you know how much I love you, and that's where what I have to say next comes from, from a place of love. You've been away a lot lately for days at a time, and we know you've been using drugs. You even missed my graduation last week. I miss you, Dad misses you, and we love you. Will you sit down with us to talk more about this?\"\n\nHelping a good friend - \"You know, Jennifer, we've been friends since we were little kids, and I consider you to be like a sister. While I know you have a lot going on, I have noticed that you've been cancelling a lot of our plans and showing up late and high. You also don't seem to be getting along with your family as much as you used to. I'm worried and concerned about you. I care very much about you and want to talk more about this.\"\n\nHelping a coworker - \"Dale, you're one of the best thinkers in this office but you've been missing a bunch of work lately. And just this week, I couldn't submit my report because I was missing your section. Lately you just haven't seemed to be yourself, and I know you've been using drugs. If you're having any problems, I wanted to let you know that I'd be happy to help you get the assistance you need. You're valuable addition at this company, and I don't want this to affect the security of your job.\"\n\n, Once you have explained your concerns, broach the topic of getting help and treatment with the person. A promise from the person to cut back or stop the problem activity is insufficient; treatment, support, and new coping skills necessary to overcoming addiction. Explain what kind of treatment you have in mind. As with other chronic diseases, the earlier addiction is treated, the better.\n\n\nDo your research before recommending a treatment plan or center. There are many different varieties and cost is not always indicative of treatment effectiveness. Treatment typically depends on the severity of the addiction. You'll need to think about cost, of course, along with other factors such as the type of therapy offered (group, individual, combination, drug, etc.), the type of facility (outpatient, residential, etc.), and gender dynamics (co-ed or same-sex environment), among others.In most cases, outpatient or residential rehabilitation programs are needed to end heroin addiction. Prescription medication is usually necessary to help the person detox safely.After this, researchers have found that 12-step programs are useful as an inexpensive and effective way of maintaining abstinence from drug and alcohol addiction.Note as well that most people who are addicted to drugs, especially ones that can be expensive such as heroin, cannot financially pay for their own treatment so you will likely need to assist in that regard. There are also some state-funded treatment centers, available through SAMHSA., No matter what the person's response is to your confrontation, let her know that you are there for her when she is ready to get help.\n\n\nIf your friend agrees to treatment, be ready. Call the local number for NA to get a schedule of meetings for your area, for example. You could also talk to someone at a nearby treatment center so that you can have the name of a place and contact ready. Let the person know that you will accompany her to the institution, meeting or specific individual that you have recommended.\nYour friend may respond with anger, rage or indifference. Denial in particular is one of the symptoms of drug addiction. Don't take it personally and avoid responding emotionally in kind. Instead, assert that you are trying to help her., The person may not think she needs the assistance you have suggested. Don't feel as though you have failed; you have at least planted a seed of recovery that can grow in the person's mind. However, if the person refuses treatment, you should be ready with a plan for what's next.\n\n\nWhat will you do if the person refuses? This may involve cutting the person off from money and other resources (so that you are no longer enabling the addiction) or even asking her to leave your home (particularly if you have other friends or family members who may be at risk due to this person's addiction).It is not easy to let a loved one who's addicted to drugs go. However, stay in touch and make it clear to the person that if any point she opts to reconsider treatment, your door is always open. Remember, you are helping the person to heal. Sometimes, we need to endure the pain of a friend or loved one in order to provide her with the help she needs to get well. This is why it's called tough love - because it is not an easy way to help someone but you may be able to save someone's life.\n\n, You must be careful with your own behavior and your attitude towards the person struggling with addiction. Be consistent and mean what you say to them; don't make empty promises or threats. For example, following through on an offer to \"Do whatever I can to help\" may be interpreted in a variety of ways. Does this mean helping the person find a local chapter of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) or giving her money (which the addict could then buy drugs with)? Be very clear about your intentions to avoid confusion. The same goes for consequences. If you tell the person that next time she is caught using, she will be kicked out, you need to be prepared to follow through.\n\n\nAlways make sure you stick to what you say – this is the most important rule because it shows the person that you are trustworthy and that what you say holds weight. If you say you will do something for the person in return for something she has done, then do it. If she fails to do what you asked, don't do it. If you give her a warning, carry it out if she doesn't listen.\nCreating and maintaining an environment of trust is of critical importance. Avoid trust-breaking behaviors, like screaming, nagging, lecturing and making promises and threats.\n\n, Break out of a cycle of dependency whereby the addict relies on you and, in turn, your assistance inadvertently helps the person keep up the addiction. This is called negative enabling. Learn to say \"no\" and commit yourself to it; it is perhaps one of the most important components of bringing about transformation in an addict. It's also important to note that the addict will likely not respond well to your commitment to saying \"no\" since she may be used to getting what she wants and when. If the person is a family member or friend, you'll need to think about money in particular. Decide if you are willing to lend the person money or not. Many people don’t like to lend money knowing that it will be spent on drugs, whilst others see it as stopping the addict from perhaps committing crime and getting into further trouble if she is caught. Make up your mind about this matter and stick to it. If you don't want to lend money, firmly let the person know the reasons you are unwilling and don't waver. If you are willing to lend to the person, have her sign debtor's notes for each loan and let her know that you plan to pursue any unpaid debts. If the person does let you down, stop lending to her.In addition, don't enable the behavior or try to keep up with the person by joining in the drug use. You need to keep yourself safe first and foremost.\n\n, Avoid covering up or making excuses for the person's behavior or taking over the person's responsibilities (whether they be work, family, or otherwise). Doing so shields the person from the negative consequences of her behavior. She needs to learn that what she is doing has adverse consequences.\n\n, Very few people addicted to heroin manage to complete a detox and remain clean on their first attempt. If your loved one does relapse, don't lose faith and do something drastic like disown her or kick her out. Remember that most people relapse a few times before they make it. Even when the person is past the withdrawal stage, recovery is not yet a certain thing as it encompasses much more than just getting rid of the person's physical dependency on heroin.\n\n\nHeroin addiction is not all physical. When someone is trying to recover from heroin addiction, they also need to deal with the mental aspects of their addiction and the triggers that led the person to engage in the behavior in the first place. Even though the withdrawal symptoms might have gone, the mental addiction will still be there, urging her to use again. Thus, treatment will have to involve dealing with those underlying issues in order to truly remove the impetus to relapse.\nIf (or when) the person fails, don't take it as a personal insult and instead offer support for the next time she tries.\n\n, Be supportive and try not to be suspicious of the person all the time; appreciate that it is hard to overcome a heroin addiction and show compassion for this trial. Instead of nagging the person when she slips or falls on the path to recovery or trying to control her every move and behavior, offer understanding and empathy. The very fact that the person wants to try to get better and beat the addiction is encouraging.\n\n\nRemember that recovery is not linear, like going simply from point A to point B. There are lots of ups and downs. Don't keep asking the person if she is still clean or lecturing her about not starting again. If you're constantly nagging the person, she will begin to lose trust and comfortability with you and may even start keeping things from you.\n\n, Offer provide praise and encouragement when the person does something to further her recovery or as a way to mark a milestone on the path to recovery (such as one-week sober or 30 days sober). This is also called positive enabling, which refers to behaviors that encourage change in a person addicted to drugs.Enable the person to continue her recovery and her path of change by reminding her that you love her and that you too are committed to her betterment.\n\n, Once the person is receiving treatment, whether that be by entering a rehabilitation center, seeing a therapist, or going to meetings, remain an active part of their recovery process. Getting the person to get help and treatment with only the first stage of recovery. Your loved one will need your support in order to carry on with the treatment and be successful in beating the addiction. Show the person that you are invested in her and her long-term recovery.\n\n\nOne way to stay involved is to try to attend therapy sessions or meetings that allow guests of people addicted to drugs. This may also help you build understanding and empathy as you will come to learn about heroin addiction and how it affects people.\nInquire about the person's recovery. However, rather than ask the person in a Q-and-A format or other style that resembles an interrogation rather than a conversation (e.g. \"Did you go to a meeting today?\";\"Did you talk in therapy today?\", etc.), consider asking open-ended questions that allow the person to shape the narrative they want to tell (e.g., \"How have the meetings been going?\" and \"Have you learned anything new about yourself throughout this process?\").\n\n, Heroin is a narcotic that comes from the opiate family, a class of pain killing drugs (analgesics) derived from the Opium Poppy (Papaver somniferum). For 7,000 years, this plant was the most effective painkiller known to medicine. Typically sold as a white or brown-colored powder that is \"cut\" with sugar, starch, powdered milk or quinine, heroin can be used in many ways, including through intravenous injections, smoking and snorting.Smoking heroin has become more popular since the 1990s due to fears of HIV infection through intravenous needle-sharing. Smoking is also the major method of using heroin in Asia and Africa.\n\n, Heroin exerts its primary addictive effect by activating mu-opioid receptors (MORs, similar to the endorphin and serotonin receptors which are responsible for happiness) in the brain. The brain regions and neurotransmitters affected by heroin are responsible for producing the pleasurable sensation of \"reward\", the relief of pain, and physical dependence. Together, these actions account for the user's loss of control and the drug's habit-forming action. In addition to being a powerful painkiller, heroin also depresses the central nervous system activity, making the heart rate and breathing slow down and suppressing the cough.Soon after using, heroin crosses the blood-brain barrier. Heroin is converted to morphine in the brain and then binds to opioid receptors. Users report feeling a \"rush\" or surge of pleasurable sensation. The rush's intensity is tied to the quantity of drug taken as well as the quickness with which the drug enters the brain and binds to the receptors. Heroin is particularly addictive because it enters the brain so rapidly. The effects are almost immediate and the user may initially feel sick. A feeling of calm and warmth then spreads through the body and any troubles or pains seem very distant and unimportant.This \"high\" will continue until the effects wear off, usually 6 to 8 hours after a hit. The user will then need to start thinking about where to score and\/or where to get the money from for the next hit before physical withdrawal sets in.\nKnow that heroin users can talk and think coherently. Even with doses sufficiently high to produce euphoria, there is little change to coordination, sensation or intellect. At higher doses the user slips into a dreamlike state where she is not asleep or awake, but somewhere between. Pupils become tiny (pinned) and the eyes roll back. This is referred to as 'nodding' or 'halucinodding' or opium dreams.\n\n, Within as little as a week of usage, a person can develop a physical dependence on heroin. Although some users may take it occasionally, heroin offers most people an unparalleled state of mind and once used, most find it difficult not to keep going back for more.\n\n\nIt has been documented that it only takes three consecutive days of heroin use to become addicted, remembering that there are different levels of addition and withdrawal. Most people will not notice the subtle withdrawal symptoms after this short a period and may put it down to feeling a little down, getting a cold, etc.\nThe two issues with addiction are the length of use and the average morphine content in the body. Usually though, people will notice that they have become addicted between one to two weeks after beginning consistent daily use. After this amount of time, stopping will result in obvious withdrawal symptoms.\nOnce someone becomes addicted, finding and using heroin becomes her main goal., When helping a person addicted to heroin withdraw, it is important to know the facts and symptoms. Withdrawal occurs a few hours after taking the drug, once the effects start to wear off and the body has broken down the heroin in the blood stream. Heroin and other opiate withdrawal symptoms are extremely uncomfortable and are not likely to be fatal or lead to permanent injury, but can cause death to the fetus of a pregnant addict. Symptoms include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, trouble sleeping, diarrhea, vomiting, cold flashes, and restless legs.For short term users: After the last dose, users will normally start experiencing mild withdrawal symptoms around 4-8 hours later. These will get worse until they peak on the second day without a hit. This is the worst day, with things slowly improving from the third day onwards. These acute symptoms are usually greatly improved by the fifth day and are largely gone in seven to ten days.\nFor longer term users: Acute withdrawal (which is considered the first 12 hours without heroin) is followed by a \"protracted abstinence syndrome\" or 'PAWS' (post acute withdrawal syndrome) which can continue for up to 32 weeks afterwards. The symptoms that continue over this time are: restlessness; disturbed sleep patterns; abnormal blood pressure and pulse rate; dilated pupils; feeling cold; irritability; change of personality and feeling; and, intense craving for the drug.\nOften the hardest part of detox is not the withdrawing itself but staying off it altogether. To remain drug-free, a whole change of life is required. New friends, keeping away from areas where you used to score, and finding things to relieve the boredom and time you would have spent using the drug are among the things that have to change as well as wanting to stay clean.\n\n, Addiction to drugs is a lifetime struggle. It takes willpower and endurance to make changes. Sobriety may be achieved, but the person may always face tremendous temptation to use. It is difficult to change your whole life, since fighting a drug addiction also means having to change other habits and parts of a person's life, such as where they go and who they see socially. Even \"normal\" activities like watching television are totally different when you're clean. This is why so many people get clean and then relapse.\n\n\nIt is also worth remembering that many people use heroin to escape or cope with personal problems, such as a history of abuse or assault, low self-esteem, and depression, among other reasons. A person addicted to heroin has to fight through the agony of withdrawal only to then be faced with all the same problems she was escaping from in the first place, but now with the added burden of heroin cravings to deal with.\n\n",

        "text":"John M. Lewellen (September 16, 1930 – November 25, 2017) was an American politician. He was elected and served on the Little Rock City Board of Directors, the Pulaski County Quorum Court and in the Arkansas State Legislature representing the district in which he resided. He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he was succeeded by his wife, Wilhelmina Lewellen who served until 2010. John Lewellen is the only Arkansas official to have been elected and represented his district on the city, county and state level.\n\nJohn Marshall Lewellen was born September 16, 1930 in Forrest City, Arkansas.  He was the 11th of 13 children born to Cornelius and Jesse Lewellen. He attended Dansby Elementary School and  professed a hope in Christ at an early age at Taylor Chapel which was named after his grandfather, Taylor Dansby. \nHe graduated from Lincoln High School in Forrest City and served in the U.S. Air Force 1951-1955 during the Korean War. \n \nThe first of his family to attend college, John attended Arkansas AM&N (now UAPB) where he met Wilhelmina Epps.  They were married on November 25, 1956.  Their first daughter, Ivie Rochelle, was born while they pursued and completed their college education. \n \nAfter graduating from AM&N in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in agriculture, John Lewellen and his family moved to the Altheimer\/Hermitage area, where he worked as a high school teacher and principal.  The family moved to Little Rock after the birth of their second daughter, Cornelia Ann, where John began his 30-year career in state government as a state probation officer, state rehabilitation counselor and later as a contractor officer for the Arkansas Department of Human Services.\n\nOver the past 54 years, John Lewellen was a highly respected member of the Little Rock community and his neighborhood.  He gave back to the community by buying and rehabbing apartments and homes, ultimately purchasing a senior citizen apartment building, which he named ConIvie Gardens, after his two daughters.  He co-founded the Wright Avenue Neighborhood Association, one of the strongest neighborhood groups in the city.  To many, he was \"Mr. Lew,\" the \"go-to guy\" for advice and guidance, and a mentor to youths, especially young men.  Many would spend Saturdays with him doing yard work, washing cars, or repairs at his rental properties, while he taught them the importance of a strong work ethic and being a strong black man.\n\nJohn Lewellen wanted to do even more for the community and decided to run for public office.  He was elected to the Little Rock City Board in 1991 and the Pulaski County Quorum Court in 1996.  In 1999, he was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives and represented District 34 for six years.  During his tenure he co-founded the Democratic Black Caucus, chaired the Children and Youth subcommittee, and worked for growth of minority- and women-owned businesses among other issues.  He was the primary and lead sponsor of House Bill 1923 - AN ACT TO CREATE THE MOSAIC TEMPLARS OF AMERICA CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.  This legislation generated more than $5 million for restoring the Mosaic Templars Culture Center, a museum of the Dept. of Arkansas Heritage that houses the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame as well as a collection of African American artifacts. The Mosaic Templars Museum is part of the Arkansas Black Heritage Tour and is Arkansas's only state-funded museum of African American History. John Lewellen received numerous awards for outstanding and dedicated service from organizations, including the Arkansas Municipal League, National Association of Minority Contractors, the Arkansas Police and Bar associations, among others.  His term ended in 2004 due to term limits.\n\nHaving seen Wilhelmina emerge as a leader in her own right after serving as both Basileus of Beta Pi Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and as the president of the local chapter of The Links, Inc., John Lewellen encouraged his wife Wilhelmina to run for his soon to be vacated position.  Wilhelmina reluctantly agreed though she did not have public office experience. Wilhelmina won with an overwhelming 84 percent of the vote and continued his legacy and created one of her own holding the seat until she was also term limited in 2010.\n\nJohn Lewellen is the only elected official in the State of Arkansas to serve on the City, County and State levels of government.\n\nJohn Lewellen was a life member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the NAACP, Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, and served on a number of boards and committees.  He was an outdoorsman who loved fishing, animals, and nature. After a lengthy illness, he died early in the morning on November 25, 2017—his and Wilhelmina's 61st wedding anniversary.\n\nReferences\n\n1930 births\n2017 deaths\nMembers of the Arkansas House of Representatives\nAfrican-American schoolteachers\nSchoolteachers from Arkansas\nAfrican-American state legislators in Arkansas\nArkansas Democrats\n20th-century African-American people\n21st-century African-American people",

        "text":" You may have trouble understanding or accepting that your ex seems okay after the breakup if the breakup was difficult for you. You may want to know that they are as miserable as you are. Instead, you can deal with your ex a lot better and handle interactions with them if you accept the fact that they seem fine with the breakup.\n\n\nIf someone tells you that your ex is doing okay or if you see your ex and they seem okay, then just be happy for them. For example, if a friend says, “Ashley seems cool after the breakup”, you could say, “Okay, that’s good. That makes me happy.”\nUnless you are prepared to hear that they are happy without you, avoid asking your ex if they are really doing okay or happy since the breakup. You might not like their response.\nKeep in mind that just because your ex seems fine doesn’t mean that’s necessarily the case. Your ex may just be acting that way so you don’t know how upset they are.;\n, You can deal with an ex who seems fine after your breakup by keeping your distance.You don’t have to avoid them like the plague, but do make sure that you aren’t going out of your way to interact with them.\n\n\nAvoid trolling their social networking profiles looking for new posts and pictures. For instance, you should resist checking their Facebook profile daily to see if their relationship status has changed.\nDon’t call, text, or message your ex unless you have a legitimate reason. For example, calling because you have a child together is a legitimate reason. Calling because you saw your ex’s favorite car isn’t.\n\n, Depending on the circumstances of the breakup, you may have some built up anger or resentment toward your ex. When you have interactions with your ex and they seem fine after the breakup you will be able to handle it if you remain respectful. You should also be respectful when you are talking to other people about your ex.\n\n\nAvoid yelling, scream, crying or making a scene when you are interacting with your ex.

        "text":" Planning ahead for a time in your day when your body can catch up on zzz’s will help your body prepare for sleep when it comes. Additionally, just knowing a nap is coming is enough to lower your blood pressure. If possible, plan to have a nap every day. Having a regularly scheduled nap will help your body adjust to the routine and make it easier to fall asleep.\nIf you have trouble working in a nap, consider short amounts of free time like breaks between classes, your lunch hour, or even a five or ten minute break from work. People take breaks to smoke, so why shouldn't you take a break to nap?;\n, If you were entirely free to plan your day and had no commitments, what time would you naturally get up and go to sleep? Sticking as close as you can to your body’s natural rhythm will help you feel like you get the most out of your sleep.Most people experience a “dip” in their level of alertness around mid-afternoon, and that is typically the best time for a nap.Typically, a good rule of thumb is to time your nap about 6-8 hours after you wake up., The length of your nap depends on how long you have to sleep, and how alert you want to be after you wake up.Taking a short nap can be energizing, but a long nap may cause you to fall into a deep sleep that's hard to wake from.\n\n\nNaps of 20-30 minutes can help to improve mood, alertness and performance, without the grogginess that results from longer sleep. When your nap is under 45 minutes, you spend most of the time in Stage 2 sleep, which can increase concentration and alertness, sharpen motor skills, and elevate your mood while minimizing \"sleep inertia\" (the feeling of grogginess and disorientation after waking). If you sleep 45 minutes or more, your body will slip into a deep, slow-wave sleep. When you wake from this sleep, you may experience sleep inertia (the feeling of grogginess and disorientation after waking), though it will help if you’re feeling behind on sleep (though not as much as sleeping 90 minutes or more).A full sleep cycle takes at least 90 minutes. Napping for 90 minutes or longer will reduce sleep inertia, because you will wake from REM sleep., Don’t waste a lot of time trying to get to sleep; find a place where you can lie down and stay comfortable. Lying down is best; it can actually take 50 percent longer for you to fall asleep while sitting upright.If you're at home, the obvious place to nap is your bed. At work or school, see if you can use an unoccupied room with a couch. Sneaking away to your car is also an option.\nPlan to use the same spot every day. You'll start thinking of it as your napping spot, making it easier to fall asleep quickly.\n\n, A light covering can help you fall asleep. If it's hot outside, a sheet provides comfort without the weight of a blanket. No matter the weather, don’t use a heavy blanket for napping; excess warmth can make you oversleep., Don't let a full bladder wake you up while you are sleeping; use the bathroom before you lie down. Make this part of your daily napping routine. While you're in the bathroom, you might want to wash your face and make other preparations to make your body more comfortable, just as you might before going to bed at night.\n\n\nConsider brushing your teeth if you're napping after lunch.\nYou may want to change your clothes, too. If you're not at home, remove your shoes at the very least.\n\n, If you are worried you might be disturbed, lock the door. You can put a sign outside the door letting others know when you will be available. Once the door is locked, you'll be able to rest more easily, since you won't be anticipating someone walking in.\n\n, Take a break from answering calls. You will still be able to use the alarm function on the phone even if it is silenced or on vibrate. It's important to silence your phone, even if you aren't expecting a call, so you can forget about the possibility that it might ring.\n\n, Keeping light and noise to a minimum will help you get to sleep and stay asleep.If you don't have blinds or curtains on the window, put a sheet over it so you can block out the light. If you are unable to control your environment, use a sleep mask or noise-canceling earbuds to reduce noise and light.\n\n, Our thoughts and worries always seem to get louder when we lie down to fall asleep. Try different exercises to quiet your mind. Making a habit of doing these exercises will help lull you to sleep more quickly. .\n\n\nUse a mantra, a short repeated phrase, to center your mind.\nVisualize a relaxing place like a beach or a forest to help clear your thoughts.Count sheep.\n\n, Breathe slowly and deeply to help your body relax. If you feel like you’re holding tension in your body, concentrate on tightening, then relaxing your muscle groups one at a time. Doing some light stretches before lying down for a nap can also be helpful.",

        "text":"After the rebuttal:\n\nThe paper contains an interesting set of results (mainly produced after the initial submission), but novelty is limited, and presentation is suboptimal. \n\nFor me now the biggest problem now is that the title and the content do not correspond. The authors clearly attack deterministic encoder-decoder models (as described in 3.2), which are not at all the same as generative models, even though many generative models make use of this architecture. A small experiment with sampling is interesting, but does not change the overall focus of the paper. This inconsistency in not acceptable. The whole issue could be resolved for example by simply replacing \"generative models\" by \"encoder-decoder networks\" in the title. Then I would tend towards recommending acceptance.\n\n------\nInitial review:\n\nThe paper describes three approaches to generating adversarial examples for deep encoder-decoder generative networks (trained as VAE or VAE-GAN), and shows a comparative analysis of these. While the phenomenon of adversarial examples in discriminative models is widely known and relatively well studied, I am not aware of previous work on adversarial examples for generative networks, so this work is novel (there is a concurrent work by Tabacof et al. which should be cited, though).  The paper has significantly improved since the initial submission; still, I have a number of remarks on presentation and experimental evaluation. I am in the borderline mode, and may change my rating during the discussion phase.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1) The paper is 13 pages long - significantly over the recommended page limit of 8 pages. Reviewers have to read multiple papers, multiple versions of each, it is a lot of work. Large portions of the paper should be shortened and\/or moved to the appendix. It is job of the authors to make the paper concise and readable. \"in our attempts to be thorough, we have had a hard time keeping the length down\" is a bad excuse - it may be hard, but has to be done.\n\n2) I intentionally avoided term \"generative model\" above because it is not obvious to me if the attacks described by the authors indeed attack generative models. To clarify, the authors train encoder-decoders as generative models (VAE or VAE-GAN), but then remove all stochasticity (sampling) and prior on the latent variables: that is, they treat the models as deterministic encoders-decoders. It is not a big surprise that a deterministic deep network can be easily tricked; it would be much more interesting to see if the probabilistic aspect of generative models makes them more robust to such attacks. Am I missing something? I would like the authors to clarify their view on this and adjust the claims in the paper if necessary.\n\n3) The paper is motivated by possible attacks on a data channel which uses a generative network for compressing information. Description of the attack scenario in 3.1 does not look convincing to me. It takes a huge amount of space and I do not think it adds much to the paper. First, experiments on natural images are necessary to judge if the proposed attack could succeed in a realistic scenario and second, I am not aware of any existing practical applications of VAEs to image compression: attacking JPEG would be much more practical. \n\n4) Experiments are limited to MNIST and, in the latest version, SVHN (which is very nice). While no good generative models of general natural images exist, it is common to evaluate generative models on datasets of faces, so this would be another very natural domain for testing the proposed approach. \n\nSmaller remarks:\n1) Usage of \"Oracle\" in 3.2 does not look appropriate - oracle typically has access to (part of) ground truth, which is not the case here as far as I understand.\n2) Beginning of section 4: \"All three methods work for any generative architecture that relies on a learned latent representation z\" - \"are technically applicable to\" would be more correct than \"work for\". \n3) 4.1: \"confidentally\"",

The goal is to minimize the maximal load over all bins\nusing a small number of rounds and few messages.\n  While the case of $m=n$ balls has been extensively studied, little is known\nabout the heavily loaded case. In this work, we consider parallel algorithms\nfor this somewhat neglected regime of $m\\gg n$. The naive solution of\nallocating each ball to a bin chosen uniformly and independently at random\nresults in maximal load $m\/n+\\Theta(\\sqrt{m\/n\\cdot \\log n})$ (for $m\\geq n \\log\nn$) w.h.p. In contrast, for the sequential setting Berenbrink et al (SIAM J.\nComput 2006) showed that letting each ball join the least loaded bin of two\nrandomly selected bins reduces the maximal load to $m\/n+O(\\log\\log m)$ w.h.p.\nTo date, no parallel variant of such a result is known.\n  We present a simple parallel threshold algorithm that obtains a maximal load\nof $m\/n+O(1)$ w.h.p. within $O(\\log\\log (m\/n)+\\log^* n)$ rounds. The algorithm\nis symmetric (balls and bins all \"look the same\"), and balls send $O(1)$\nmessages in expectation per round. The additive term of $O(\\log^* n)$ in the\ncomplexity is known to be tight for such algorithms (Lenzen and Wattenhofer\nDistributed Computing 2016). We also prove that our analysis is tight, i.e.,\nalgorithms of the type we provide must run for $\\Omega(\\min\\{\\log\\log\n(m\/n),n\\})$ rounds w.h.p.\n  Finally, we give a simple asymmetric algorithm (i.e., balls are aware of a\ncommon labeling of the bins) that achieves a maximal load of $m\/n + O(1)$ in a\nconstant number of rounds w.h.p. Again, balls send only a single message per\nround, and bins receive $(1+o(1))m\/n+O(\\log n)$ messages w.h.p.\n",

Contact me at the following address, xyz@mail.com, here is my public key.\n\nPublic-key cryptography (i.e. asymmetric cryptography) works by the creation of two keys, public and private, for use in the scheme.  Anyone may encrypt something using the public key (anyone with the right tools, that is), but only one with the private key (disregarding other factors, such as the key strength) may decrypt it.  \n\nWhat typically happens, then, is that the public key is provided *publicly*, while the private key is kept, well, private.  However, in certain situations, it may be necessary to verify the identity of someone else; public-key cryptography provides methods by which to accomplish just this.  This is called 'digital signing,' or the encryption of something with a private key.  Assuming a third party has this entity's public key, their identity can thus be verified.\n\nIn the generation of a public\/private key pair, these keys are related, such that encrypting something with the public key allows for the subsequent decryption using the private key.  An actual algorithm that might demonstrate this is beyond my understanding, but I did find these helpful paragraphs from the Wikipedia entry [on the subject](_URL_0_):\n\n >  With a symmetric key system, Alice first puts the secret message in a box, and locks the box using a padlock to which she has a key. She then sends the box to Bob through regular mail. When Bob receives the box, he uses an identical copy of Alice's key (which he has somehow obtained previously, maybe by a face-to-face meeting) to open the box, and reads the message. Bob can then use the same padlock to send his secret reply.\n\n >  In an asymmetric key system, Bob and Alice have separate padlocks. First, Alice asks Bob to send his open padlock to her through regular mail, keeping his key to himself. When Alice receives it she uses it to lock a box containing her message, and sends the locked box to Bob. Bob can then unlock the box with his key and read the message from Alice. To reply, Bob must similarly get Alice's open padlock to lock the box before sending it back to her.\n\n >  The critical advantage in an asymmetric key system is that Bob and Alice never need to send a copy of their keys to each other. This prevents a third party (perhaps, in the example, a corrupt postal worker) from copying a key while it is in transit, allowing said third party to spy on all future messages sent between Alice and Bob. So in the public key scenario, Alice and Bob need not trust the postal service as much. In addition, if Bob were careless and allowed someone else to copy his key, Alice's messages to Bob would be compromised, but Alice's messages to other people would remain secret, since the other people would be providing different padlocks for Alice to use.",

Finally, we find a new double-coupling between the density\nfluctuations integrated along the line of sight, and gradients in the density\nfluctuations coupled to transverse velocities along the line of sight.

However, author provides no analysis along with those equations. It is therefore not clear what insight the author tries to express in those sections. In addition, feedback RNN is not evaluated in the experimental section, so it is not clear why feedback RNN is described.\n\n- The experimental evaluation is limited. Only one dataset enwik8 is explored.

Also they don't propagate the prediction error in the same way, they both leverage \"extra\" supervised information through the prediction errors.\n\n\nIn summary:\nPros: \n- Interesting idea\n- Seems to improve performances\n\nCons:\n- Paper writing\n- Weak evaluation (only one dataset)\n- Compare only with approaches that does not use the last-timestep error signal",

First, the Electoral College is unfair to voters  Second, there could be a tie in the electoral vote. Last, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electors rather than the president. To start this off the Electoral College is unfair to the voters.  Because of the \"winner-take-all system in each state\", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the \"swing\" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what he\/she is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election.  Second, there could be a tie in the electoral vote.  In the case of the tie it would go straight to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote for the president. By this the House's decision is no where close to that of the people in their state. The election is omly a few swing voters away from catastrophe. That's why it is bad if the vote ends in a tie.  Lastly, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electors rather than the president. For instance, if you \"lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" The worst part is that the electors could be anyone you don't even have to hold a political position to be an elector, they could be very biased and narrowminded. That's why the Electoral College is unfair.  In conclusion Mr. Senator the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational because it is unfair to voters, there could be a tie in the electoral vote and the voters are merely voting for a slate of electors and not there president.

        "text":"Is quality not better than quantity? Technology has advanced to be an incredibly efficient resource that educators have taken notice of and have attempted to integrate within online schools and online programs. However, although online schooling is a quick way to receive an abundance of information, it is not always a quality education students are receiving. Students benefit less from taking online classes at home the assignments are not designed for retention the students fall behind in course work.  Although students may groan and complain about schooling, it is abundantly clear that students absorb the majority of information and techniques they are taught in school; however, the same cannot be said for online schooling. When students attend school, the staff has policies and measures put in place to observe if students are learning or are in need of help. If a teacher finds that a student is struggling, the teacher can meet with that student and confirm that they understand the material. With online schooling, however, the monitoring of students is made extremely difficult without direct face-to-face contact. Some students are too shy or too stubborn to ask for help; with online teachers relying on weekly video conferences and students emailing them with their concerns, an entire group of students are isolated and continues to struggle. Some may argue that online courses should be able to record student progress through test scores and quiz grades, but without a teacher to watch for cheating, many students use the internet to look up answers and falsely increase their scores. Without the ability to directly observe students, online courses turn to creating more assignments for students to complete in hopes of catching where the student is lacking. This leads to an abundance of busywork that may sometimes hardly pertain to the subject being taught and costs hours of the students time. Many students sign up for online learning to have a flexible schedule but are faced with the harsh reality that the coursework within online courses takes much more time to complete than the work within a class taken at a school. This causes many students to adjust their mindset from learning information to getting the workload down and done as fast as possible as the expense of retaining the material taught. Suppose a mother decided to pursue an online education in order to earn a degree while taking care of her child. The projects and assignments that are piled onto the mother has potential to distract her from her child. Prioritizing the baby, the mom begins working on the material with the goal in mind not to learn but to finish the work so that she is able to attend to the baby. She may complete the course and earn the credit but ultimately she would not absorb any of the information taught to her as she was overwhelmed by the busywork. The ultimate goal of education is learning and retaining the information and skills taught; online education fails to accomplish that goal due to the busywork it presents and the lack of direct communication.  Although students like to deny it, procrastination controls a large portion of students' work ethic. Many students rely on schedules and due dates to stay on top of assignments and as encouragement to start working. However, many online courses are advertised as flexible and only contain one due date for when the entire course ends. Although it may seem like a blessing to manipulate scheduling and due dates, many students fall under the control of procrastination. Even in physical schools, students push off their assignments and projects to the last minute in order to play video games or hang out with friends, but as the due date falls closer, students employ the dread of a failing grade to kick start their work ethic. Supporters of online schooling may argue that procrastination is not a valid reason for disapproval in online schooling since both online and physical schooling produce procrastination. However, while physical schooling leads to small, short periods of procrastination, online schooling allows students to procrastinate the entire course over months. In addition, procrastination is increased with online schooling as the students' homes act as classrooms. There are numerous distractions and comforts (such as beds and pets) at a students' houses that encourage students to put off work that do not exist in a physical classroom. Suddenly, as the date for the course to end nears, students scramble to finish the work they put off for so long leading to sub par effort and work from the students. For example, high school students have extremely busy lives between classes, extracurriculars, and spending time with friends. If a high school student were to take an online course and did not receive any due dates except for the date the course ends, the student would have no stimuli to begin working on the course. This may seem like a gift at first because the student has more time to hang out with friends or study, but as the end of the course nears, there will be no time at all for studying or hanging out with friends. Online courses boast a flexible schedule, but it does more harm than good. Students push off working on assignments until the workload is too large and then panic to finish the material leaving behind less than average work.  Although technology has made great advancements for society and education, it cannot replace learning with peers and a teacher in a classroom. Online schooling observes a students progress through quantity not quality and encourages students to push off large amounts of work. Online schooling completely misses the goal of teaching and allows students to complete a course without retaining any of the material, a issue caused from lack of communication. In addition, by eliminating due dates, students procrastinate up to the last minute and turn in sub par work.",

        "text":"The Rite of the Holy Sepulchre, commonly called the Carmelite Rite, is the liturgical rite that was used by the Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre, Hospitallers, Templars, Carmelites and the other orders founded within the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem.\n\nHistory \nThe rite in use among the Carmelites beginning in about the middle of the twelfth century is known by the name of the Rite of the Holy Sepulchre, the Carmelite Rule, which was written about the year 1210, ordering the hermits of Mount Carmel to follow the approved custom of the Church, which in this instance meant the Patriarchal Church of Jerusalem: \"Hi qui litteras noverunt et legere psalmos, per singulas horas eos dicant qui ex institutione sanctorum patrum et ecclesiæ approbata consuetudine ad horas singulas sunt deputati.\"\n\nThis Rite of the Holy Sepulchre was one of the many variations of the Roman Rite with additions from the earlier Gallican rites that came into existence after Charlemagne decreed that the whole of his realm adopt the Roman Rite; it appears to have descended directly from the Parisian Rite, but to have undergone some modifications pointing to other sources. For, in the Sanctorale we find influences of Angers, in the proses traces of meridional sources, while the lessons and prayers on Holy Saturday are purely Roman. The fact is that most of the clerics who accompanied the Crusaders were of French nationality; some even belonged to the Chapter of Paris, as is proved by documentary evidence. Local influence also played an important part. The Temple itself, the Holy Sepulchre, the vicinity of the Mount of Olives, of Bethany, of Bethlehem, gave rise to magnificent ceremonies, connecting the principal events of the ecclesiastical year with the very localities where the various episodes of the work of Redemption had taken place. The rite is known to us by means of some manuscripts one (Barberini 659 of A.D. 1160) in the Vatican library, another at Barletta, described by Kohler (Revue de I'Orient Latin, VIII, 1900–01, pp. 383–500) who ascribed it to about 1240.\n\nThe hermits on Mount Carmel were bound by rule only to assemble once a day for the celebration of Mass, the Divine Office being recited privately. Lay brothers who were able to read might recite the Divine Office, while others repeated the Lord's Prayer a certain number of times, according to the length and solemnity of the various offices. It may be presumed that on settling in Europe (from about 1240) the Carmelites conformed to the habit of the other mendicant orders with respect to the choral recitation or chant of the Divine Office, and there is documentary evidence that on Mount Carmel itself the choral recitation was in force at least in 1254.\n\nThe General Chapter of 1259 passed a number of regulations on liturgical matters, but owing to the loss of the acts their nature is not known. Subsequent chapters very frequently dealt with the rite chiefly adding new feasts, changing old established customs, or revising rubrics. An Ordinal, belonging to the second half of the thirteenth century, is preserved at Trinity College, Dublin, while portions of an Epistolarium of about 1270 are at the Maglia, becchiana at Florence (D6, 1787). The entire Ordinal was rearranged and revised in 1312 by Master Sibert de Beka, and rendered obligatory by the General Chapter, but it experienced some difficulty in superseding the old one. Manuscripts of it are preserved at Lambeth (London), Florence, and elsewhere. It remained in force until 1532, when a (committee was appointed for its revision; their work was approved in 1539, but published only in 1544 after the then General Nicholas Audet had introduced some further changes.\n\nThe reform of the Roman liturgical books under Pope Pius V called for a corresponding reform of the Carmelite Rite, which was taken in hand in 1580, the Breviary (Divine Office) appearing in 1584 and the Missal in 1587. At the same time the Holy See withdrew the right hitherto exercised by the chapters and the generals of altering the liturgy of the order, and placed all such matters in the hands of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. The publication of the Reformed Breviary of 1584 caused the newly established Discalced Carmelites (associated with Saint Teresa of Ávila and Saint John of the Cross) to abandon the ancient rite once for all and to adopt the Roman Rite instead.\n\nRoughly speaking, the ancient Carmelite Rite of Mass stands about half way between the Carthusian and the Dominican rites. It shows signs of great antiquity – e.g. in the absence of liturgical colours, in the sparing use of altar candles (one at low Mass, none on the altar itself at high Mass but only acolytes' torches, even these being extinguished during part of the Mass, four torches and one candle in choir for Tenebræ); incense is also used rarely and with noteworthy restrictions; the Blessing at the end of the Mass is only permitted where the custom of the country requires it; passing before the tabernacle, the brethren must make a profound inclination, not a genuflexion. Many other features might be quoted to show that the whole rite points to a period of transition. Already according to the earliest Ordinal, Communion is given under one species (i.e. bread, not wine), the days of general Communion being seven, later on ten or twelve a year with leave for more frequent Communion under certain conditions. Extreme Unction was administered on the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, both hands (the palms, with no distinction between priests and others) and the feet superius. The Ordinal of 1312 on the contrary orders the hands to be anointed exterius, but also without distinction for the priests; it moreover adds another anointing on the breast (super pectus: per ardorem libidinis).\n\nIn the Mass there were some peculiarities. The altar remained covered until the priest and ministers were ready to begin, when the acolytes then rolled back the cover; before the end of the Mass they covered the altar again. On great feasts the Introit was said three times, i.e. repeated both before and after the Gloria Patri; besides the Epistle and Gospel there was a lesson or prophecy to be recited by an acolyte. At the Lavabo the priest left the altar for the piscina where he said that psalm, or else Veni Creator Spiritus or Deus misereatur. Likewise after the first ablution he went to the piscina to wash his fingers. During the Canon of the Mass the deacon moved a fan to keep the flies away. At the word \"fregit\" in the form of consecration, according to the Ordinal of 1312 and later rubrics, the priest made a movement as if breaking the host. Great care was taken that the smoke of the thurible and of the torches did not interfere with the clear vision of the host when lifted up for the adoration of the faithful, but the chalice was only slightly elevated. The celebrating priest did not genuflect but bowed reverently. After the Pater Noster the choir sang Deus venerunt gentes, i.e., Psalm 78 (79), for the restoration of the Holy Land. The prayers for communion were identical with those of the Sarum Rite and other similar uses, viz. Domine sancte Pater, Domine Iesu Christe (as in the Roman Rite), and Salve salus mundi. The Domine non sum dignus was introduced only in 1568. The Mass ended with Dominus vobiscum, Ite missa est (or its equivalent) and Placeat. The chapter of 1324 ordered the Salve regina to be said at the end of each canonical hour as well as at the end of the Mass. The Last Gospel, which in both ordinals serves for the priest's thanksgiving, appears in the Missal of 1490 as an integral part of the Mass. On Sundays and feasts there was, besides the festival Mass after Terce or Sext, an early Mass (matutina) without solemnities, corresponding to the commemorations of the Office. From Easter till Advent the Sunday Mass was therefore celebrated early in the morning, the high Mass being that of the Resurrection of our Lord; similarly on these Sundays the ninth lesson with its responsory was taken from one of the Easter days; these customs had been introduced soon after the conquest of the Holy Land. A solemn commemoration of the Resurrection was held on the last Sunday before Advent; in all other respects the Carmelite Liturgy reflected more especially the devotion of the order towards the Blessed Virgin.\n\nThe Divine Office also presented some noteworthy features. The first Vespers of certain feasts and the Vespers during Lent had a responsory usually taken from Matins. Compline had various hymns according to the season, and also special antiphons for the Canticle. The lessons at Matins followed a somewhat different plan from those of the Roman Office. The singing of the genealogies of Christ after Matins on Christmas and the Epiphany gave rise to beautiful ceremonies. After Tenebræ in Holy Week (sung at midnight) came the chant of the Tropi; all the Holy Week services presented interesting archaic features. Other particularities were the antiphons Pro fidei meritis etc. on the Sundays from Trinity Sunday to Advent and the verses after the psalms on Trinity, the feasts of St. Paul and St. Laurence. The hymns were those of the Roman Office; the proses appear to be a uniform collection which remained practically unchanged from the thirteenth century to 1544, when all but four or five were abolished. The Ordinal prescribed only four processions in the course of the year: on Candlemas, Palm Sunday, the Ascension and the Assumption.\n\nThe calendar of saints, in the two oldest recensions of the Ordinal, exhibited some feasts proper to the Holy Land, namely some of the early bishops of Jerusalem, the Biblical Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Lazarus. The only special features were the feast of St. Anne, probably due to the fact that the Carmelites occupied for a short time a convent dedicated to her in Jerusalem (vacated by Benedictine nuns at the capture of that city in 1187), and the octave of the Nativity of Our Lady, which also was proper to the order. The Chapter of 1306 introduced the feasts of St. Louis, Barbara, Corpus Christi, and the Conception of Our Lady (in Conceptione seu potius veneratione sanctificationis B. V.); the Corpus Christi procession dated only from the end of the fifteenth century. In 1312 the second part of the Confiteor, which till then had been very short, was introduced. Daily commemorations of St. Anne and Saints Albert and Angelus dated respectively from the beginning and the end of the fifteenth century, but were transferred in 1503 from the canonical Office to the Little Office of Our Lady. The feast of the \"Three Maries\" dated from 1342, those of the Visitation, of Our Lady ad nives, and the Presentation from 1391.\n\nFeasts of the order were first introduced towards the end of the fourteenth century – viz. the Commemoration (Scapular Feast) of 16 July appears first about 1386; Elisha prophet, and Cyril of Constantinople in 1399; St. Albert in 1411; St. Angelus in 1456. Owing to the printing of the first Breviary of the order at Brussels in 1480, a number of territorial feasts were introduced into the order, such as St. Joseph, the Ten Thousand Martyrs, the Division of the Apostle. The rapture of Elijah (17 June) is first to be found in the second half of the fifteenth century in England and Germany; the feast of the Prophet (20 July) dates at the earliest from 1551. Some general chapters, especially those of 1478 and 1564, added whole lists of saints, partly of real or supposed saints of the order, partly of martyrs whose bodies were preserved in various churches belonging to the Carmelites, particularly that of San Martino ai Monti in Rome. The revision of 1584 reduced the Sanctorale to the smallest possible dimensions, but many feasts then suppressed were afterwards reintroduced.\n\nA word must be added about the singing. The Ordinal of 1312 allowed fauxbourdon, at least on solemn occasions; organs and organists are mentioned with ever-increasing frequency from the first years of the fifteenth century, the earliest notice being that of Mathias Johannis de Lucca, who in 1410 was elected organist at Florence; the organ itself was a gift of Johannes Dominici Bonnani, surnamed Clerichinus, who died at an advanced age on 24 October 1416.\n\nCurrent use \nThe Order of Discalced Carmelites was formally erected on 20 December 1593 by the Apostolic Constitution Pastoralis officii of Pope Clement VIII under its own Praepositus General, as such it had no formal relationship with the Carmelite rite. Although many of its early members had formerly been friars of the Province of Castille, still against the recommendations of St. John of the Cross who voted to keep the rite, the new Order effectively eschewed the rite and adopted the Roman rite. The reason they gave was that the principles of the Tridentine liturgical reforms was the attempt to tidy up the particular rites of Orders and Primatial Sees so that there was a greater conformity to Roman usage; this was not to stifle long-standing legitimate variation but to ensure that liturgy reflected theology (lex credendi, lex orandi).\n\nAfter considering the question at its General Chapters of 1965, 1968 and 1971, the Order of Carmelites of the Ancient Observance (formerly styled \"calced\") decided in 1972 to abandon its traditional rite in favour of the Mass of Paul VI.\nOver the last decade or so, a group of Carmelites living in North America (Lake Elmo, Minnesota and Christoval, Texas) adopted the eremitical life and have been experimenting with the new forms of the Carmelite rite according to the conciliar norms. The hermits see in it a return to something of the older usage, a liturgical pattern that is better suited in style and shape to the needs of a contemplative community that spends much longer in choir than the friars.\n\nA number of Masses were celebrated according to the Carmelite Rite in July 2012 at St Joseph's Church, Troy, New York by Fr Romaeus Cooney O.Carm. This represented the first time that the Carmelite Rite has been celebrated publicly in over forty years.\n\nThe Carmelite Rite is still offered regularly by the Carmelite Friars of St. Elias province of Middletown, NY. St. Joseph’s Church in Troy, NY continues to celebrate the Carmelite Rite on a regular basis.\n\nThe cloistered religious community of the Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel in Wyoming celebrate mass according to the traditional Latin liturgy of the Carmelite Rite.\n\nThere was an ad experimentum revision of Holy Week that was published in 1953, issued by the then Prior General, Most Rev. Kilian E. Lynch, O.Carm.  The main Carmelite missal was never republished, but used by the Carmelite Order from 1937 (its last edition) until they gave up the rite in 1972.\n\nSee also\n\nLatin liturgical rites\nList of Catholic rites and churches\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nIndex of Carmelite Websites\nCarmelite Spirituality\nNon-Roman Latin or Western Rites (some information based on the New Catholic Encyclopedia of the 1960s)\nProper for the Liturgy of the Hours\nVideo of Mass according to the Carmelite rite, celebrated by the former Prior General, Most Rev.

Sometimes this happens because you were sitting or sleeping in a funny way, or sometimes it's because you were playing really hard, or maybe for no reason at all, these strings get all tangled up in a little area and it stretches all the other strings and really hurts!  You can often get rid of these knots by pushing down on the knot or rubbing it really hard, trying to straighten the strings back out.  It can really hurt a *lot* when you are doing this, but you usually feel better after!

        "text":"There are several ways to get light (or other electromagnetic waves, like radio) to carry information.   \n   \nOne simple way is to use signalling. You can pulse the light on and off like [Morse code](_URL_0_). As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code, you can transmit information.  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems. (They don't use Morse code, and it is much much faster than a human could do. But it's the same general idea.) This technique isn't really used with radio broadcasts, though. \n  \nAnother way is to *modulate* the signal.  If you think of EM radiation as an [oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields](_URL_1_) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency, then you have a lot of ways to change it.  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send, you've got [Amplitude Modulation](_URL_2_). If you change the frequency to be a bit faster\/slower according to what you want to send, you've got [Frequency Modulation](_URL_2_). There are also other methods like *Phase* Modulation that are a bit more complicated.  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together, such as AM and PM.   \n  \nThat .gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal.  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals, and that's given a different name. For example, using FM to modulate a binary signal is called [Frequency Shift Keying](_URL_3_).  \n   \nYou can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send.  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly, very rapidly, according to the information you want to send. Of course, you can't see radio waves because the human eye doesn't detect them, but the concept is exactly the same. Radio is just colors of light we aren't built to detect directly with our senses.",

        "text":"  UTIs are painful, inconvenient, expensive to treat, and taking loads of antibiotics frequently isn't good for your body.  It may even make future infections resistant to antibiotics and make women more susceptible to yeast infections.  For both men and women, I recommend three things that will make a profound difference.\n\n\nPractice good hygiene.  A big cause of UTIs is e. coli, which can come from your digestive system.  Sexual activity, from the constant movement, can push this type of bacteria into the urethra. Always make sure your privates are clean from the front to back.  Washing the genitals with water (or an intimate cleanser) and washing your behind with warm soap and water in the shower will help immensely. Baby wipes after using the bathroom can be used too.\nAlways, ALWAYS pee after sex.  Many people claim this interferes with 'cuddle' time, but you can cuddle after going to the bathroom.  This is the single most overlooked and ignored step that prevent UTIs more than anything.  Peeing after sex can flush out any bacteria that may have been pushed into your urethra. Explaining this to your partner can ease any frustration, and they should be able to understand.\nOf course, make sure you are hydrated enough so that you can go to the bathroom frequently.  Drink lots of water!;\n,  There are only two things you will need. Yes, only two. AGAIN: If you are on any medication, have strong taste aversion, or are pregnant, please DO NOT attempt this.\n\n\nDried Neem leaves (can be found in an Indian grocery or online) WARNING: Do NOT use Neem Oil, this is the oil from the same plant and is toxic when ingested, not powder, ONLY the dried leaves.\nD-Mannose powder (can be found online or at Whole Foods in capsule form)\n\n,  This will brew a strong, bitter tea that is naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  It is also known as an abortifacient, which is why it is not recommended for pregnant women.\n\n\nPut a few ice cubes in the pot to cool down the tea, since you will want to start drinking it immediately.\n\n,  With the first glass, take your first dose of d-mannose powder.  You can't really overdose on d-mannose since it is a naturally derived from cranberries, so I recommend taking 3-4 capsules every hour or so.\n\n\nThe neem tea has a very bitter taste, and is highly unpleasant to drink because of its bad taste.  If you can, try to drink the rest of your tea in the pot throughout the day.  If needed, drink water in between if the taste is too strong.\n\n,  You should be urinating quite a lot due to the high fluid intake, and both should flush bacteria out of the bladder and urethra.\n\n,  If not, then I would highly recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary physician or OB\/GYN as soon as possible. In serious cases, UTIs can lead to kidney infections, so it is imperative to treat the problem swiftly.  If all else fails, you can find your nearest Minute Clinic at a local drugstore and they should be able to prescribe you antibiotics.  Last resort: go to the hospital if none of these options are available.\n\n",

Actually, this happens _all the time_, but 99.999% of the time you don’t notice it because the vast majority of your short-term memories get converted to long-term memory, and you can usually easily retrieve it from there back into short-term and continue the train of thought.\n\nOccasionally, this conversion fails and the memory does not become long-term. In such cases, the short-term memory will eventually cease to exist and then you’re left with a gap.\n\nHave you seen the movie _Memento_? It approximates what it’s like for someone who cannot form new long-term memories at all and to whom this phenomenon is constant and permanent. You can live more or less normally for a few minutes, then suddenly forget all about what just happend.\n\nIn real life, the condition is called [anterograde amnesia](_URL_0_) (to contrast against _retrograde amnesia_, which is the kind of amnesia more commonly depicted in film, but actually rarer in reality). According to a real-life patient, [Clive Wearing](_URL_1_), it feels like waking up (and you cannot remember the dream you just had). He had a habit of keeping a journal, so he kept updating that journal after his accident that gave him anterograde amnesia. He kept writing something like “I’m now awake”. Then he crossed that out and wrote “I’m now definitely awake”. Then crossed that out again and wrote “I’m now absolutely awake” or something, and so on. The reason for this is that he couldn’t believe that he wrote the earlier lines because he had no memories of it, so he thought they were fake and crossed them out.",

        "text":"I took a class on subtitling in college and it's really important to realize that subtitles, be them for deaf\/hard-of-hearing or from on language to another, are a form of poetry. When you bring in time into the situation of reading all kinds of rules pop up. How many characters you can use is a big one, so you might rather use the word \"gross\" over \"disgusting\" for the sake of a shorter subtitle that can actually be read in time. You might correct someone's stutter or mis-speak, unless of course it is critical to the film. \n\nThe main goal of subtitles is to make the film watchable for someone who can not hear or for someone who does not speak the language the film is in. This means you will make sacrifices, jokes will be lost, information in general will be lost, cultural references, and word play are very common examples.\n\nIn response to the initial question, the subtitler  should use their best judge of whether what needs to be subtitled and what doesn't. Does a visual explosion need \" < Explosion Sound > \" no it does not, but say an explosion is happening and it is silent! Now the subtitle \" < Silence > \" would be super helpful to the viewer.\n\nOne last factor, is depending on the movie you saw it could have been subtitled with computers which do a terrible job. The best subtitles are still done by humans who can use their best judgement as to what should be included.\n\nEDIT: As others brought up it's important to not confuse closed captioning and subtitling. Watch a Criterion DVD if you want to see A+ human done subtitles, watch Netflix or the live news if you want to see a computer type out what it \"hears\". To properly answer the original question I'd need to actually see what the OP saw. I have subtitled films before, one a documentary and some 1920s short films french- >  english. I had the script to neither, and of course the documentary didn't have one. Having script would help discern what someone is saying, but it does not always take into account things subtitles do (nor does it take into account tone or the way a word is said which is very important). This includes when the camera cuts, when it's a voice over dub, music, etc. A subtitle is only up right when the person starts talking, and down as soon as they are finished. If they're talking fast, better come up with something that sums it all up. If they're talking and mid-sentence it cuts, you do a new subtitle, this one being in italics (because the character speaking is not on screen). There's a language to subtitling you may understand without even realizing it. Download a freeware subtitling program, you subtitle frame by frame you the precision with nicer programs is amazing. First you go through the movie marking where subtitle will be then you go back and type in what each subtitle is. As you go you keep notes that you refered to or spelled things the same way the whole time. So if you refer to an \"automobile\" as a \"car\" in the subtitles to save space you better keep using the word \"car\" throughout the whole movie as not to become confusing. This goes double for slang you translate or type out.",

We\nobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, in\nboth data sets with the same timings. The ingress occurred before sunset and\nwas not observed. The full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2\nhours. The data allows the planetary radius to be measured (Rp = 0.9 +- 0.1\nRJup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. Radial velocity\nmeasurements show the detection of a prograde Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, and\nprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. If confirmed, this misalignment\nwould corroborate the hypothesis that HD 80606 b owes its unusual orbital\nconfiguration to Kozai migration. HD 80606 b is by far the transiting planet on\nthe longest period detected today. Its unusually small radius reinforces the\nobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux received\nfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. Orbiting a quite bright star\n(V=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.\n",

I felt like mentioning this solely because I enjoy scarves.\n\nEDIT: it has been pointed out to me that your neck isn't being warmed per se, since room temperature pieces of fabric can't exactly transfer heat to objects that are higher than room temperature.

        "text":"Nowadays online shopping has become more and more common, resulting in the majority of people to refer to the web when purchasing items. However, the items shown on websites may not always be parallel to what it is like in real life. Making a first-hand decision can often lead to something that is unwanted, not satisfactory, or a waste of money. To prevent this, people should seek multiple opinions to help them make a better choice now and possibly in the future. This is why asking advice from more that one person is beneficial and how it helps someone gain the confidence to know that the decisions they make are correct.  Most of the times the choices someone will make causes an effect on another thing. When a bad decision is made, this can lead to circumstances that someone would rather stay away from. For example, a person has spent money on something they wanted, but later realize it was bad quality and it was not what they expected it to be. This does not only put them in a place where they have something that is disliked, but now they have also wasted their time and money when that item was bought. Instead, that person should look up that item to see what other people had to say about it or ask peers who have purchased that item their thoughts on it  This will not only bring them to a choice that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money.  The choices someone will make are usually decided on their point of view, meaning that their decision are based solely of what they think. When someone goes to multiple viewpoints, they can see the different perspectives on how people view things. This will lead them to be more open-minded on what they choose to do. Having a more open-mind can then lead to better choices and wisdom for the future. For example, if someone knows that a specific company provides low quality items, they can know that in the future they should not buy items from that company. This means that what a person learns from making a good decision from others opinions now, can also help them make other better decisions in the future.\n Many say that you should \"follow your gut,\" but this can lead to many difficult positions.  Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.         ",

There is nothing in the literature that links the subject of hearing loss and tinnitus with orgasm. Therefore, I can only deduce on the basis of first principles of physiology. I certainly do not think that a prospective randomized double blind controlled human study on this matter would ever pass the ethics committee.\n\nThe good news\n > Here is my first hypothesis: that the sudden reduction in heart rate and blood pressure results in sudden pressure changes in the middle ear and reduction of blood flow to the inner ear. The middle ear is a finely tuned piece of engineering. Changes in pressure within it would change the acoustic properties of sound transmission through the eardrum and hearing bones. This might result in a muffled hearing. In addition, the reduction of blood flow to the inner ear cochlea might mean that the hearing nerves might experience a transient reduction of essential nutrients, which results in temporary faulty signaling to the brain. This might explain the hearing loss and tinnitus.\n\n > My second hypothesis relates to what happens in the brain itself. During sex and orgasm, the areas in the brain that gets switched on are the nucleus accumbens (reward center), hypothalamus (oxytocin production), amygdala (emotions), hippocampus (memory storage), and cerebellum (muscle tone). More importantly, the parts of the brain that gets deactivated are the prefrontal cortex (decision making and executive thought) and the temporal lobe (hearing and sensory association center)—that last bit is important. My second hypothesis therefore is that the change in the activity of the temporal lobe after orgasm results in a change in auditory perception. This may result in some people having a change in their threshold for experiencing tinnitus. In addition, the release of chemical endorphins may also change the activities of the neurotransmitters in the brain, causing a change in sensory perception.\n\nThat's *probably* the best answer you're going to get.",

You can find one in several ways:\n\n\nVisit the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, at www.mass.gov\/eopss.\n\nFollow the link to \"Firearms Registration and Laws” in the top right corner of the page.\nSelect “Approved Basic Firearms Safety Courses\" to access a complete list of courses approved by the state of Massachusetts.\n\n\nCall the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security at 617-727-7775 to speak with someone about enrolling in one of the approved courses.\nContact the police department for the city or town where you reside, and ask them about upcoming courses in your area. For example, the City of Worcester lists courses directly on its website.;\n, The purpose for taking the course is to become educated on Massachusetts firearms laws, in addition to learning how to safely handle a firearm. Some courses are offered by local police departments, and some courses are offered by private companies.The basic firearm safety course will include the following:shooting practice and training\nunderstanding the parts of the firearm\nunderstanding ammunition\nsafe storage and security of firearms\nreview of Massachusetts firearms laws (some private companies may offer broader classes that could satisfy applying for a license in other states as well)\n\n, After you successfully complete the firearms safety course, you will receive a Firearms Safety Certificate. You will need to submit a copy of this certificate when you apply for a Massachusetts gun license.\n\n, Your request for a gun license begins by completing the “Massachusetts Resident LTC\/FID\/Machine Gun Application” form. You can get a copy of the form from one of three possible sources:\n\n\nIf you have Internet access, you can print an application directly at home from the website of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security.If you do not have Internet access, you can call the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security at 617-727-7775 to request an application by mail.\nAlternatively, visit your local police station and request a copy of the application form.\nAdditional forms that you might need, such as an application as a non-resident, an application as a resident alien, or a Firearms Licensing Review Board Petition, may be found at the website of the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security’s Firearms Forms and Applications page., You will need to complete the form carefully, either by typing or printing clearly and legibly all the answers. It is important that you read the instructions before completing the form. If you have any questions while completing the application, you should contact your local police department., If this is your first application, indicate that you are a new applicant by placing a check mark next to \"New Applicant\" at the top of the form. If this is for a renewal license, you will check “Renewal” and provide your most recent license number., For example, if you just want the license to purchase a firearm and keep it at home, then you need what is called an FID. Place a check mark next to \"Firearms Identification Card.” If you are requesting permission to carry a firearm, you need the LTC license. You should select “License to Carry.”, You will be required to enter your name, address, the date and place of your birth, the names of your parents, your physical traits, occupation and employer information, and either your Social Security Number or drivers license number., You will be asked for information regarding your citizenship, past convictions or felonies, whether you have ever suffered from mental illness, drug, or alcohol addiction, if you have ever been involved in domestic violence, and if there are any outstanding warrants for your arrest.If you answered \"yes\" to any of the inquiries on the questionnaire, you will be required to provide details about the circumstances surrounding each inquiry.\n\n, In some cities or towns, you may also be required to submit a written letter of recommendation from these people. Check with the local police about this requirement., The police need to monitor the number of applications they approve and the reasons for them. You need to be truthful in this step and not look for an answer that you believe the police want to hear. If you believe you need it for personal security, then say so. If you can provide more reasons (recent shootings in your area, etc.), that may help your explanation., Sign and date the appropriate fields at the bottom of the gun licensing application. Your application will be incomplete without your signature and probably will be returned to you without being processed., The state law sets the basic requirements for gun license applications, but the final decision is made by the local chief of police for each city or town in Massachusetts. Each police department has some leeway in the documentation that they require with each application.\n\n\nFor example, some towns require a copy of your birth certificate, but other towns will accept different forms of identification.\nSome towns may require written recommendations from your two reference people; other towns would only require their names and contact information.\n\n, In any city or town, for a new license, you will need to submit proof that you have completed a firearms safety training course. Have a copy with you when you submit your application.\n\n, The license application fee is generally $100. Check with your individual city or town to verify the amount and the form of payment that is accepted.\n\n\nFor example, the City of Everett only accepts payment by money order.The City of Worcester will accept payment by cash, check or money order.For other cities or towns in Massachusetts, contact the police department directly.\nThe City of Billerica has instructions on its website that you are to get a Receipt for Payment form from the Police Station, take that form to the City Treasurer to pay the $100 fee and get the receipt verified, and then take the verified receipt back to the Police Station to submit with the application., You should call the police department or check its website to see if there are certain times that they accept applications.\n\n\nFor example, the City of Worcester requires applicants to make appointments in advance, which are only scheduled on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays.The City of Everett has a link on its website to schedule an appointment to submit your application.The City of Billerica website instructs applicants to contact the clerk for information about applying, but no specific appointment information is included.If you need help locating the nearest police department, call the Massachusetts State Police at 508-820-2300 to find an office that will process your application.\n\n, Some departments will require your fingerprints along with the application. After you submit your application, along with the accompanying materials, the police will run a background check both within Massachusetts and in any other states where you have lived, using the information provided on the gun licensing application. The police department will then inform you of the method and time frame in which you will receive your gun license.\n\n, All lawful residents of Massachusetts, regardless of official citizenship, are eligible to get a license to possess or carry a firearm in Massachusetts. There are some ways for a non-resident of Massachusetts to obtain a temporary gun license for a specific purpose. If this applies to you, then contact the police department for the city or town where you will be visiting., Your record does not need to be absolutely clean, but there are limitations. The state law is very clear that no gun license may be issued in Massachusetts to anyone who has been convicted of any of the crimes described below. If any of these apply to you, you should read the full text of the law carefully and consult with an attorney:a felony\na misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of more than two years\na violent crime\ncertain crimes related to gun or ammunition possession, distribution or sale\ncertain crimes related to the use of controlled substances\nmisdemeanor crimes of domestic violence\n\n, Nobody may hold a gun license in Massachusetts who has been committed to a hospital for mental illness, alcohol or substance abuse, or who has had a guardian appointed on the basis of mental incapacity, or who has been found to have an alcohol or substance use disorder. There are some exceptions, if the applicant is able to produce a doctor’s findings attesting that the condition no longer applies at the time of the application. If any of these descriptions apply to you, you should read the full text of the law carefully and consult with an attorney., An applicant for a license to carry a firearm (LTC) in Massachusetts must be at least 21 years old at the time of filing the application. An applicant for a firearms identification card (FID) must be at least 15 years old, with parental permission. An applicant who is at least 18 years old can apply for an FID without parental consent., The state law says that the license may be denied for anyone who is deemed “unsuitable to be issued” a license. The determination of whether you are “suitable” is up to the chief of police for the city or town in which you live and apply for the license. This determination is based on “reliable and credible information” that the applicant has engaged or may engage in behavior that would cause a risk or danger to society.",

        "text":"The Duchy of Massa and Principality of Carrara () was a small state that controlled the towns of Massa and Carrara from 1473 until 1829.\n\nHistory\n\n \nAlthough the city of Massa had already known its maximum medieval splendor in the 11th century with the Marquisate of Massa and Corsica ruled by the Obertenghi family, the original nucleus of the state was officially born on 22 February 1473 with the purchase of the Lordship of Carrara by the Lordship of Massa in the time headed by the Marquis Jacopo Malaspina, who obtained it from Count Antoniotto Fileremo of Genoa, progenitor of the Fregoso line. The noble title of the Malaspina family therefore became that of Marquises of Massa and lords of Carrara.\n\nFrom the purchase of the Carrara territory onwards, the seat of Jacopo Malaspina, one of the sons of Antonio Alberico I Malaspina, member of the branch of the family located in Fosdinovo, was located in the city of Carrara, but due to the frequent clashes with the French invaders who occurred often, he and his successors moved to Massa.\n\nWithin two generations the Malaspina family died out in male descent and Ricciarda, Iacopo's niece and last direct heir of the lineage, married in 1520 with Lorenzo Cybo, a member of an influential family of Genoese aristocrats related to the Medici and Pope Innocent VIII. From the marriage the new Cybo-Malaspina family originated: the son of Ricciarda and Lorenzo, Alberico I Cybo-Malaspina obtained the government of Massa and Carrara in 1554. Under his administration the fiefdom experienced a very favorable period of development, thanks also to the advantageous economic situation in the marble market, which was in great demand by the Renaissance courts of the time. Alberico I, aware that his statelet was surrounded by more powerful and influential neighbors, decided to submit to the Holy Roman Empire of Charles V of Habsburg in 1554. Thanks to its cultural and economic successes, the city of Carrara obtained the rank of marquisate in 1558. In 1568 Massa was elevated to principality by the Emperor Maximilian II. In 1664 Leopold I of Habsburg raised the Principality of Massa to the rank of duchy and the Marquisate of Carrara to a principality.\n\nThe Cybo-Malaspina took the title of Dukes of Massa and Princes of Carrara starting from Alberico II. In 1741 Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, the only representative of the family, married Ercole III d'Este, the only male heir of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. Their daughter Maria Beatrice d'Este thus had the government on both territories, which however remained separate state entities until her death.\n\nIn 1796 the Este were deprived of their possessions by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte. The latter incorporated the territory into the Cispadane Republic, then making it flow into the Cisalpine Republic. During this period the region was briefly disputed against Napoleon by the Austrians of the anti-French coalition (1799) and experienced a rapid succession of different administrative systems, more or less provisional. As a last administrative change, in 1806, the French emperor assigned the Duchy of Massa and Carrara to the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, governed by his older sister Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi. During the Napoleonic domination Maria Beatrice d'Este (then ruler of the Duchy) was forced to take refuge in Vienna with the family of her husband, Ferdinand Karl, Archduke of Austria-Este, uncle of Emperor Francis II, from whom she governed her duchy in exile. With the fall of the Napoleonic regime, the Congress of Vienna again assigned to Maria Beatrice the ancestor duchy that had been stolen from her. After the Restoration and the end of the independence of various local entities such as the Marquisate of Fosdinovo, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara included, in addition to the traditional territories, numerous others territories in Tuscany.\n\nIn 1829, on the death of Maria Beatrice, the duchy of Massa and the principality of Carrara were annexed to the duchy of Modena and Reggio, led by her son Francis IV. In 1860, with the deposition, the previous year, of Francis V, the duchy of Modena and Reggio (also including the territories of Massa and Carrara) was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia, of which it constituted the province of Massa and Carrara.\n\nMarquis, Princes, then Dukes of Massa and Carrara\n Giacomo I Malaspina (1445–1481)  Marquis of Massa and Lord of Carrara since 1473\n Alberico II Malaspina (1481–1519)\n Ricciarda Cybo-Malaspina (1519–1546) and (1547–1553)\n Giulio I Cybo-Malaspina (1546–1547)\nAlberico I Cybo-Malaspina (1554–1623) Marquis of Massa and Carrara from 1558, then Prince of Massa and Marquis of Carrara from 1568\nCarlo I Cybo-Malaspina (1623–1662)\nAlberico II Cybo-Malaspina (1662–1690) Duke of Massa and Prince of Carrara from 1664 \nCarlo II Cybo-Malaspina (1690–1710)\nAlberico III Cybo-Malaspina (1710–1715)\nAlderamo Cybo-Malaspina (1715–1731)\nMaria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina (1731–1790)\nMaria Beatrice (1790–1796) Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara\n Annexation of the Cispadane Republic, Cisalpine Republic, Italian Republic and Kingdom of Italy following the invasion of Napoleon (1796–1806)\n Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi (1806–1814)\n Maria Beatrice (1815–1829) Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara\nThe duchy is annexed to the Duchy of Modena\n Francesco IV d'Este (1829–1846)\n Francesco V d'Este (1846–1859)\n\nPolicy and economy\nThe merge of the Malaspina family with the Cybo family brought the territory to a rather lavish court life. In the conduct of foreign policy the Cybo-Malaspina maintained a role as an intermediary between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Republic of Genoa.\n\nAlberico I brought large urban restructurations in the cities of Carrara and Massa, mainly for prestige reasons. Both cities were equipped with new city walls - with representative functions, rather than military, since the policy of the territory was not expansionist  - and new ducal palaces. In Carrara was established the Office of Marble (1564), to regulate the marble mining industry.\n\nThe city of Massa, in particular, saw much of its plan redesigned (new roads, plazas, intersections, pavings) in order to make it worthy of an Italian country's capital.\n\nThe War of Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was the beginning of the period of deep economic crisis for the duchy. The Empire punished with heavy fines the Cybo-Malspina, who had given hospitality to French troops on its territory. Already Alberich III, but especially Alderamo, found themselves forced to sell many city goods. Alderamo arrived to force people to buy food at a premium, and also because of the luxurious and extravagant lifestyle of the nobleman, the economics of the Duchy was brought to its knees. The financial situation recovered only by dynastic union between the families of the Malaspina and the Este, achieved with the marriage of Maria Teresa and Ercole d'Este in 1741.\n\nFrom that date, the Duchy of Massa and Carrara gradually lost its political autonomy, going to gravitate more and more closely into the city of Modena sphere of influence. Under the domination of the Este, the Duchy of Massa Carrara rose to occupy a strategic position, in that it provided a sea outlet to the hinterland domains and promised an easier trade route. Already under Maria Teresa road links between the Duchy of Modena and Reggio to Massa & Carrara were significantly improved. These road reform attempts include the construction of the  Via Vandelli, starting as early as 1738.\n\nIn 1751, was made a first attempt for the excavation of a dock and the construction of a port in the city of Carrara. The port would have been functional to the trade and military activities of the Este, would have housed in a safe place the small fleet of the Duchy of Modena and, finally, would have been essential to free the marble exports from dependence of other nearby ports. The coast, however, had a tendency to silt up and after a few years the construction work had to be suspended.\n\nIn 1807 Napoleon's engineers built the important mail road to the Foce, to link the cities of Massa and Carrara through the inland hills. During the Napoleonic rule were also initiated other public works such as the bonification of the plains, the plantation of coastal pine trees to combat malaria and arrangement of river banks. These works were continued by Maria Beatrice and successors in subsequent decades.\nIn 1821 the Este Land Registry was established, with the task of regulating and listing the properties of the inhabitants of the duchy.\n\nThe years following the annexation to the Duchy of Modena were particularly complex, both for the insurrectional riots that characterized the historical period, and for the economic crisis, which have long gripped the region. The rulers tried several times to exit the stagnation in promoting the construction of infrastructure to increase the volume of trade, but the lack of money often proves an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nA second attempt to build the port of Carrara was entrusted by Duke Francis IV to the engineer Aschenden in 1830, but the project was never made for lack of funds. A dock loader, which came to be the first authentic port core of Carrara was built successfully only in 1851, thanks to the English engineer and tycoon William Walton (disambiguation).\nIn 1846 the Count Francesco del Medico proposed to the Duke Francis V the construction of the Marble Railway of Carrara, to link the marble quarries to the sea and thereby facilitating the transport of blocks to the areas for sorting, loading, and shipping. This project was also suspended for lack of funds. The Marble Railway was finally built after the Italian unification (1871–1890).\n\nIn the last years of the duchy, an increasing number of clashes was seen between the liberals and the ducal government, especially in Carrara.\nThe territory was chosen by Count Camillo Benso di Cavour and Napoleon III to organize popular anti-Austrian riots and give France an opportunity to intervene on the side of Piedmont in Italy, giving way to the Second Italian War of Independence.\n\nReferences\n\n \nItalian states\nDuchy of Massa and Carrara\nDuchy of Massa and Carrara\nDuchy of Massa and Carrara\n1473 establishments in Europe\n15th-century establishments in Italy\n1829 disestablishments in Italy\nMalaspina family\nStates and territories established in 1473\nStates and territories disestablished in 1829",

        "text":"Ross–Loos Medical Group was a comprehensive prepaid health services plan with 29 medical offices throughout Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties in California and a large multi-specialty hospital located on Temple Street, Los Angeles.\n\nFounding\nRoss-Loos was established in 1929 by two physicians, Donald E. Ross and H. Clifford Loos, older brother of writer Anita Loos. The plan consisted of monthly payments which assured benefits of medical and hospital care to over two thousand employees of Los Angeles County and the Department of Water and Power and their families.\n\nThe founders believed that health care could be improved by combining prepayment of services, eliminating the financial barriers faced by patients at the time of needed care, with the sharing of medical records and the ease of consultation in a medical group. The focus was on the improvement of medical care quality, rather than financial success, and many concepts in those plans built on a public health approach that encouraged prevention. The plans included prenatal care, well-baby visits, and immunizations in standard benefit packages, with small or zero co-payments, at a time that even the hospital costs of maternity stays were often excluded from traditional insurance.\n\nRoss–Loos Medical Group (1929) is the first HMO in the United States, the term \"managed care\" came about chiefly through the influence of U.S. President Nixon on February 17, 1971.\n\nOver several years many other employee groups, mostly governmental, joined the plan. Ross-Loos was so successful that the first small medical office on Grand Avenue in Los Angeles expanded into an enormous organization with 29 medical offices and a large multi-specialty hospital, on Temple Street, Los Angeles, by 1979.\n\nPurchases\nIn 1980, Ross–Loos Medical Group was purchased by the Insurance Company of North America (INA) HealthPlan (see HMO International and California Medical Group and merged into its medical office operations which created over twenty-nine medical office locations throughout southern California. Its new name was \"INA and Ross-Loos HealthPlans\". This new operational name was in existence a short time until 1982; through a merger of the Insurance Company of North America (INA) and Connecticut General (CG) their names changed to become CIGNA. Ross–Loos Medical Group, became known as CIGNA HealthPlans of Southern California and was merged into the large CIGNA Employee Benefits Division. In 1997 CIGNA made a decision to divest itself of its \"owned delivery system\" or \"staff model\" (see HMO – staff model) and sold their operations to MedPartners. The sale to MedPartners also caused a new name change of the CIGNA \"owned delivery system\" in Southern California, The system became merged into the recent purchase in Southern California by Medpartners of the Friendly Hills Medical Group. In 1999, MedPartners was placed in receivership for its inability to manage the combined operations of its Southern California subsidiaries Friendly Hills Medical Group, Talbert Medical Group, Mullikan Medical Group, Vineyard Medical Group, and Riverside Medical Clinic. Those MedPartners-owned facilities were divested and sold to physician-owned delivery systems or closed.\n\nThe MedPartners name was changed to Caremark Rx, the Talbert Medical Group was sold to the physicians of the Talbert Medical Group; the Riverside Medical Clinic was sold back to the member physicians, remaining in operation, with over 130 physicians; and the Mullikan and Vineyard Medical Groups were eventually closed. The Friendly Hills Medical Group was acquired by KPC Global Care, now in Chadhuri Medical Group, and briefly continued operations until it too was placed into receivership by the California Department of Corporations in 1999 and closed down. The original Ross–Loos Medical Group facilities were closed and Medical Center – Hospital on Temple Street in Los Angeles was sold to Silverlake Medical Center then eventually sold and renamed L.A. Downtown Medical Center.\n\nThe original Ross–Loos Medical Group, medical offices and hospital ended with that sale in 1999 some 70 years after its beginning.\n\nCurrent status\nThe names \"Ross-Loos\", \"Ross Loos Medical Group\", and \"Ross Loos HealthPlans\" are still owned by CIGNA Corporation and remain registered with the State of California Department of Corporations, Department of Insurance, and Department of Managed Care.\n\nA street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles bears the name Ross Loos Place.

        "text":"Affect (from Latin affectus or adfectus) is a concept, used in the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza and elaborated by Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, that places emphasis on bodily or embodied experience. The word affect takes on a different meaning in psychology and other fields. \n\nFor Spinoza, as discussed in Parts Two and Three of his Ethics, affects are states of mind and body that are related to (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings and emotions, of which he says there are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy (laetitia), pain or sorrow (tristitia) and desire (cupiditas) or appetite. Subsequent philosophical usage by Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and their translator Brian Massumi, while derived explicitly from Spinoza, tends to distinguish more sharply than Spinoza does between affect and what are conventionally called emotions. Affects are difficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, \"an affect or passion of the mind [animi pathema] is a confused idea\" which is only perceived by the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force. The term \"affect\" is central to what has become known as the \"affective turn\" in the humanities and social sciences.\n\nIn Spinoza \nIn Baruch Spinoza's Ethics, Part III Definition 3, the term \"affect\" (affectus, traditionally translated as \"emotion\") is the modification or variation produced in a body (including the mind) by an interaction with another body which increases or diminishes the body's power of activity (potentia agendi):\nBy affect I understand affections of the body by which the body's power of acting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at the same time, the ideas of these affections.\nAffect is thus a special case of the more neutral term \"affection\" (affectio), which designates the form \"taken on\" by some thing, the mode, state or quality of a body's relation to the world or nature (or infinite \"substance\"). In Part III, \"Definitions of the Emotions\/Affects\", Spinoza defines 48 different forms of affect, including love and hatred, hope and fear, envy and compassion. They are nearly all manifestations of the three basic affects of:\n desire (cupiditas) or appetite (appetitus), defined as \"the very essence of man insofar as his essence is conceived as determined to any action from any given affection of itself\";\n pleasure (laetitia), defined as \"man's transition from a state of less perfection to a state of greater perfection\"; and\n pain or sorrow (tristitia), defined as \"man's transition from a state of greater perfection to a state of less perfection\".\nIn Spinoza's view, since God's power of activity is infinite, any affection which increases the organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes in that they are vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually resist it or hold it in check.\n\nIn Bergson \nHenri Bergson contends in Matter and Memory (1896) that we do not know our body only \"from without\" by perceptions, but also \"from within\" by affections (French: affections).\n\nIn Deleuze and Guattari \nThe terms \"affect\" and \"affection\" came to prominence in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, the second volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia. In his notes on the terminology employed, the translator Brian Massumi gives the following definitions of the terms as used in the volume:\nAFFECT\/AFFECTION. Neither word denotes a personal feeling (sentiment in Deleuze and Guattari). L'affect (Spinoza's affectus) is an ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body's capacity to act. L'affection (Spinoza's affectio) is each such state considered as an encounter between the affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its broadest possible sense to include \"mental\" or ideal bodies).\nAffects, according to Deleuze, are not simple affections, as they are independent from their subject.\nArtists create affects and percepts, \"blocks of space-time\", whereas science works with functions, according to Deleuze, and philosophy creates concepts.\n\nAffective turn \nSince 1995, a number of authors in the social sciences and humanities have begun to explore affect theory as a way of understanding spheres of experience (including bodily experience) which fall outside of the dominant paradigm of representation (based on rhetoric and semiotics); this movement has been called the affective turn. Consequently, these approaches are interested in the widest possible variety of interactions and encounters, interactions and encounters that are not necessarily limited to human sensibility. The translator of Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus, Canadian political philosopher Brian Massumi, has given influential definitions of affect (see above) and has written on the neglected importance of movement and sensation in cultural formations and our interaction with real and virtual worlds. Likewise, geographer Nigel Thrift has explored the role of affect in what he terms \"non-representational theory\". In 2010, The Affect Theory Reader was published by Melissa Gregg and Gregory J. Seigworth and has provided the first compendium of affect theory writings.\nResearchers such as Mog Stapleton, Daniel D. Hutto and Peter Carruthers have pointed to the need to investigate and to develop the notions of affect and emotion. They hold that these are important in the developing paradigm of embodiment in cognitive science, in consciousness studies  and the philosophy of mind. This step will be necessary for cognitive science, Mog Stapleton maintains, to be \"properly embodied\" cognitive science.\n\nSee also\n\nAffect theory\nAffectionism\nConatus\nImmanent evaluation\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n Deleuze, Gilles. 1983.

        "text":" Learn about the styles of their homes., Start by leveling the land.\n\n, First dig a hole a depth of 20 centimeters this is the depth of the refined wooden planks. Then lay out an outline of a rectangle with your refined wooden planks that is 5 meters (length) by 10 meters (width) in the hole you made. The outline should be hollow and the planks should be the same depth as the hole you dug. Now set the planks upright and nail the corners. Fill the area inside the hollow rectangle with stones and cement. Let the cement set; it will take 28 days for the cement to cure.\n\n, Lay down the planks horizontally to the rectangular foundation. The length of the boards will be the length of the floor which is 5 meters long. One by one, nail the planks into the outside perimeter of the foundation. For added floor strength, fasten the boards to the concrete. You can do this by nailing the boards in, or use a glue that bonds to wood and concrete.\n\n, Four walls in total will be needed to create this home. One wall you will need to leave space for a door. The doors dimensions will be 2 meters by 1 meter. So this dimension has to be left empty on one wall. You can first outline a door cut in your frame.\n\n\nFirst build a frame for the wall with the height being 5 meters and the length will be 10 meters. Add wall studs every 1\/2 of a meter, which is a total of 40 studs for both frames.Add cross-sections to support the frame and the roof of the home.\nBuild a frame for the remaining two walls with the dimensions of 5 by 5. You will need a total 20 wall studs for both 5 by 5 wall. Add cross-sections to support the frame and the roof of the home.\n\n, Once all four walls are in place, do a strength test. To start this test, place varying weights onto the top plank of the wall do this for every inch of the four walls. If you see any bending, use more cross sections to strengthen the structure. If the wall needs even more strength, use triangular cross sections or more wall studs.\n\n, Use a flat piece of wood that can cover the whole area inside and outside on all four walls. You will need 8 flat pieces of wood pieces in total one for each wall covering the inside and outside area. The measurements will be the same as the frame of the wall.\n\n\nIf you have a frame that is 5 by 5, the sheet of wood will be 5 by 5. Just nail the outside perimeter of the wood sheet to the frame and the wall studs.\nIf you have a frame that is 5 by 10, the wood cover will be 5 by 10. Then nail the outside perimeter of the wood sheet to the frame\/studs.\n\n, Cut a rectangle that is less than half the area of the wall in the center of the wall you have chosen. If you choose the wall with the longest length, then you can make a wider door cut, but the height is the same on any wall.\n\n\nOnce the door outline is cut, use thick planks and nail them on the perimeter of the rectangle. The door consists of planks and nails that can be either be in a cross pattern or a preferred pattern. Finally attach the door hinges to the door and the frame and grease the hinges. Add a door knob if you would like to, although Anglo Saxons did not use door knobs.\n\n, The shape will be in the form of a triangular prism. This was the style of the Anglo Saxons and it helps prevent rain seeping into the home and ruining the floor. The width of the roof will be 5 meters and the length will be 10 meters, the height of the roof can be any size you would like to create.\n\n, You need have the frame structurally sound before nailing it to the top planks; make sure you have all of the corners nailed and solid because you don't want the roof to fall while you are in the house. To make a more solid connection you can add wood adhesive in the corners. After you have the frame complete, you must add plank cross sections for support of the shingles or straw and also to keep out debris.\n\n, This can be done with shingles or straw.\n\n\nIf you use shingles, you will have first to drill two holes in the top of each tile. Start from the top of the frame and work your way to the bottom of the both sides of the frame. Then you will have to place a peg into each tile, one by one in an overlapping pattern, until the roof is completely covered and has no holes that can cause water to leak into the home. The roof is complete!\nIf you choose the rolled straw, you will need rope to tie each bit of straw together. Starting from the top and working your way down, tie a piece of rope to each section of the wooden support beams. Make sure you have no holes where water can come in. The roof is complete!\n\n, Saw out a rectangle one-fourth the area of one wall. Build a rectangular frame.The window frame should be 4\/10 of a meter by 4\/10. Since glass was not used in the Anglo Saxon community, you do not have to worry about covering the hole.\n\n,",

In paragraph 6 the article explains how if the \"Coding System\" were to be in computers in classrooms, it could help modify lessons for students who get bored  Dr. Huang states \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

Finally, in paragraph 8 it reads \"muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.

Norton was located on the Wilderness Trail, which had been blazed by Daniel Boone, and later extensively mapped and settled by Christopher Gist. The settlement developed as a central hub for the timber trade until the coal boom of the 1830-40s.\n\nThe Hotel Norton is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGeography\nNorton is located along the Powell and Guest Rivers.  The entire area of Norton lies within the confines of Wise County, but is not a part of the county.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , virtually all of which is land.\n\nMajor highways\n\nDemographics\n\n2020 census\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic\/Latino as an ethnic category.

        "text":"The down system in American football keeps the game interesting. After all, if the offense kept running plays but never got anywhere, the sport would be really boring. Using the down system, the offense has four downs (essentially four plays) to go 10 yards. If the offensive team advances the ball at least 10 yards in four tries or fewer, the team receives another set of four downs.\n\nIf the offense has failed to advance 10 yards after three tries, the team usually punts the ball on the fourth down (a punt is a kick to the opponent without the use of a tee). The other team then begins with its own set of four downs, traveling in the opposite direction.\n\nYou may hear TV commentators use the phrase \"three and out.\" What they mean is that a team has failed to advance the ball 10 yards on its first set of downs and has to punt the ball. You don't want your team to go three and out very often. But you do want to earn lots of first downs, which you get after your team advances the ball 10 yards or more in the allotted four downs. Getting lots of first downs usually translates to more scoring opportunities, which are definitely good things.\n\nFootball has its own lingo to explain the offense's progress toward a first down. A first down situation is also known as a \"first and 10\" because the offense has 10 yards to go to gain a first down. If your offense ran a play on first down and you advanced the ball 3 yards, your status would be \"second and 7\"; you're ready to play the second down, and you now have 7 yards to go to gain a first down.\n\nAs a viewer, you aren't expected to just remember what down it is and how many yards to go for a first down. Football makes it easy by providing people and signs to help you keep track:\n\nTwo rodmen hold metal rods, with Xes at the top, connected by a chain that stretches exactly 10 yards. One rod marks where the possession begins, and the other extends to where the offensive team must go in order to make another first down.\nThe third person, the boxman, holds a marker that signifies where the ball is and what down it is. Atop this rod is the number 1, 2, 3, or 4, designating which down it is.\nIn all NFL stadiums, a person also marks where the drive began (that is, where the offensive team assumed possession of the ball). Many high school and college fields don't have these markers.\nWhenever there's a critical measurement for a first down, the chain crew is brought to the hash marks nearest where the ball is positioned, and the officials use the rods to measure whether the offense has obtained a first down.\n\nThanks to the miracle of technology, determining where a team has to advance the ball to get a first down is easier than ever if you're watching television. On the TV screen during a game, you'll see an electronic line down the middle of the field that marks where a team must go to get a first down.\n\n\nWhether on an offensive or defensive line, each player in a football lineup has a specific job to do. Each player\/position has a specific role to play. The offensive positions are shown in the lower half of the following figure, and the defensive positions are shown in the upper half. The offense and defense face each other across the line of scrimmage.\n\nimage0.jpg\nThe line of scrimmage is simply the spot on the field from which the football is hiked.\n\nThe figure shows the 4-3 defense (a four down linemen and three linebacker scheme) lined up against a strong-side-right offense. These lineups are common in the NFL, as well as at other levels of football.\n\nFootball offensive positions\nThe offense's primary job, as a team, is to move the ball down the field and score — either by touchdown or kicking a field goal. There are other ways to score as well, but those are primarily left to special teams. Within the offense, the functions are divided among these key positions:\n\nQB = quarterback: The leader of the team. He calls the plays in the huddle, yells the signals at the line of scrimmage, and then receives the ball from the center. Then he hands off the ball to a running back, throws it to a receiver, or runs with it.\n\nC = center: The player who snaps the ball to the quarterback. He handles the ball on every play.\n\nRB = running back: A player who runs with the football. Running backs also are referred to as tailbacks, halfbacks, and wingbacks.\n\nFB = fullback: A player who’s responsible for blocking for the running back and also for pass-blocking to protect the quarterback. Fullbacks, who are generally bigger than running backs, are short-yardage runners.\n\nWR = wide receiver: A player who uses his speed and quickness to elude defenders and catch the football. Teams use as many as two to four wide receivers on every play.\n\nTE = tight end: A player who serves as a receiver and also as a blocker. This player lines up beside the offensive tackle to the right or the left of the quarterback.\n\nLG and RG = left guard and right guard: The inner two members of the offensive line, whose jobs are to block for and protect the quarterback and ball carriers.\n\nLT and RT = left tackle and right tackle: The outer two members of the offensive line.\n\nFootball defensive positions\nThe defense's primary job, as a team, is to keep the offense from scoring — by tackling members of the offense, intercepting the ball, and generally preventing the offense from moving the ball close enough to their goal to create a scoring opportunity. Within the defense, the functions are divided among these key positions:\n\nDT = defensive tackle: The inner two members of the defensive line, whose jobs are to maintain their positions in order to stop a running play or to run through a gap in the offensive line to pressure the quarterback or disrupt the backfield formation.\n\nDE = defensive end: The outer two members of the defensive line. Generally, their jobs are to overcome offensive blocking and to meet in the backfield, where they combine to tackle the quarterback or ball carrier. On running plays to the outside, they’re responsible for forcing the ball carrier either out of bounds or toward (into) the pursuit of their defensive teammates.\n\nLB = linebacker: The players who line up behind the defensive linemen and generally are regarded as the team’s best tacklers. Depending on the formation, most teams employ either three or four linebackers on every play. Linebackers often have the dual role of defending the run and the pass.\n\nS = safety: The players who line up the deepest in the secondary — the last line of defense. There are free safeties and strong safeties, and they must defend the deep pass and also the run.\n\nCB = cornerback: The players who line up on the wide parts of the field, generally opposite the offensive receivers.",

        "text":" If you're going to challenge a teacher's ruling on a particular subject or question, you better make well sure you are correct and have the evidence to back it up. Do your research, and this does not mean Wikipedia. As helpful and accurate as it may be these days it just isn't seen as credible by the majority of academia and sometimes is not. However it is often a great place to start that can lead you more sound evidence through the headings at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nSearch legitimate, peer-reviewed databases such as JSTOR for data supporting your point you can present to your prof. Your teacher will be impressed that you took the effort and will be more considerate.;\n, People usually have a pride on their work. When you expose someone in public you can hurt not only their pride, but also their image as an authority and even the institution that backs them. Take care to choose the proper time and place to talk; wait after the class is over or on his\/her office. Making it into a private matter will give you a better opportunity to be heard without rising a defensive attitude.\n\n, You need to be respectful and mature without sarcasm, facial expression or any other body language that suggests opposition or defiance if you want to be taken seriously. In their mind they didn't endure 4 years of school to get their Baccalaureate degree with anywhere from 2-7 years of school on top of that for their masters or doctorate to be listening to you whine like a 5 year old about what you think is right, and frankly they are correct. This sends your credibility straight out the window. They will stop listening immediately and make up their mind that they were right. In order to be taken seriously you need to present yourself in a manner that is as non-oppositional as possible, as if you are working with or for them rather than against them. Remember that they have much more power than you and have the ultimate say.\n\n, If you feel it start to escalate remember to keep your cool. Present your point to them as if you are trying to understand why they determined you were wrong, not necessarily that you think you were right. When you present evidence, never be absolute about it. For example, I speak like this \"Ma'am, it seems that these reference supports the fact that Al Gore does indeed live on the moon, do you see my point? Rather than: \"Look at this data! There is no way you can tell me Al GORE doesn't live on the moon based on this!\". See how the first one was much less absolute and more polite? Teachers like this because they don't feel like they're being threatened. They are further more likely to explain to you why they thought you were incorrect.\n\n, Again, they will feel like they're being judged\/threatened\/being demeaned, and none of them like that. Instead, you mention that you are having difficulty learning in the style they use and politely suggest\/ask them if they can modify it a bit to help you. Contrary to popular belief, most teachers want you to succeed and do well. They certainly are grossly underpaid for what they do, and are thus not teaching for the money (unless they are doing research or are tenured), so most of the gratification of teaching comes from seeing students learn things and be able to do things because they taught them! If you put it in the context of \"I'm struggling and want to learn better\" rather than \"I need a good grade\" then they will be much more likely to help you.\n\n, Nothing is worse than having a long, drawn out, pointless argument with a teacher that you know you've already lost but you don't want to admit you're wrong. Realistically, they will not see you as any less of a person if you politely say \"OK, I understand now, thank you for clarifying this\", and if you do have an argument during this process, they will remember it for a long time and continue to grade and judge you in all interaction based on it whether it's ethical or not. Again, be civil. This stuff should give you a good shot at at least understanding why you were wrong.\n\n, Being someone who is supposed to be right and was proved wrong by their student, who should know less, is extremely embarrassing. You need to do everything you can to try to not have them embarrassed so that they will not associate you with negative feelings which could affect future interaction. This means you need to thoroughly thank them for listening to your case and that you appreciate the consideration. Show them you still have respect for them as your teacher for what they went through to get there and what they know (for which you honestly should). Remember, they didn't have to admit they were wrong.\n\n",

Federal laws come from congress, although they may be interpreted by the courts, and the executive can be granted some authority by congress in deciding how to enforce them; there's no process for involving the people as a whole, as opposed to their elected representatives.\n\nFurthermore, guns and abortion are constitutionally protected (the former explicitly, the latter implicitly) so to ban either would require either a supreme court reversal or a constitutional amendment.  The former requires appointing enough justices who agree with that position to get a majority on the supreme court (which has 9 judges, who are appointed by the President, with consent of the Senate, and serve for life), the latter requires the approval of 3\/4ths of the states.  Most anti-abortion and anti-gun legislation therefore does not involve a total ban, but adjusting regulations to make them harder to obtain.\n\nWith regard to marijuana, two states have in fact legalized through referenda, and similar votes are being proposed in other states; many other states have decriminalized it or allowed it for medical use through referenda. However, it is illegal on both the federal and state levels, and although the current president has chosen to not enforce marijuana laws in states where the state government allows it, the law remains on the books and a future administration could reverse this policy.",

Otherwise you might want to get a yoga block or folded towel for your knees to rest on.\n\n, After holding the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds, raise your legs back up until they are perpendicular with the floor. Try to keep your knees together, and maintain control over the movement., From the starting position, lower your knees to the opposite side. Hold the stretch for the same period of time, then return back to start. Pay attention to how the stretch feels on each side. Significant differences in range of motion may indicate you have a muscle imbalance on one side.A complete windshield wiper stretch is done from one side to the other. You can repeat the stretch three to five times, holding the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds.\nYou also can do a more dynamic version of the windshield wiper stretch, in which you drop your legs from one side to the other in a continual movement, synchronizing your breath with the movement. Inhale as you lower your legs, and exhale as you raise them back to start.\n\n, You can alter the positioning of your legs to make the stretch gentler if you have particularly tight hips, or are recovering from a more recent injury.For a gentler stretch, simply let both knees fall together. Flex your feet to protect your knees, feeling the stretch in your hips. Use a yoga block to rest your knees on if you can't lower them all the way to the floor and maintain proper form.\nTo challenge your hips with a deeper stretch, cross the lower ankle over the top of the outer thigh as you drop your knees over to either side.\n\n",

        "text":"As technology and digital devices improve, more and more schools have begun to utilize them by offering the option to take a class at home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to have an empty slot in their class schedule which results in students being able to come to school late or leave school early.  Allowing students to take their classes by way of online or video conferencing would not be beneficial because students would be able to cheat more easily,  it would be harder to communicate with teachers, students would get more distracted in online classes than they would in school classes.  While the internet can provide long distance communication for a student to attend an online class, the internet can also provide the answers to assignments and work that the student may be assigned.  If a student is allowed to take a class solely online, they will be inclined to cheat and look up answers. One counter argument that people have is that teachers have a way of seeing how many tabs are opened on the computer, but even if the teacher could see how many tabs were opened, the student could still use their phone or another digital device to look up answers. An online class would also make it easier to cheat because since the assignments would be all digital, students could utilize the copy and paste keys to look up answers quicker. If the student was taking the class at school instead, they could be given paper assignments and it would be harder for them to cheat. Online classes also make it easier for students to collaborate on assignments that they should be doing independently. Students could be using other students' help or they could be using previous students' work and it would be harder to identify.  Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because it would be harder to communicate with teachers  Some online classes may be taught by teachers who don't teach at the actual school the student attends. This makes it harder for students to ask them questions or ask for their help when they need it. This could cause students to not understand the topic completely and it might reflect in their grades. Online classes also make it harder for the student to build a relationship with the teacher. Because it is an online class, the student and the teacher don't really get to know each other and this could cause their relationship to be very weak. If the student was taking the in school class, they would have a stronger relationship with their teacher because the student would get to physically see and talk to the teacher every other day. The better the relationship between the teacher and the student is, the more likely it is for the student to go to the teacher and ask for help. Because the online teacher and student are not able to build a good relationship, the student might not ask questions to the teacher even if they don't understand the topic.  Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because students would be able to become distracted easier.  Because the online class is done through video, teachers can not verify that there are no distractions present for the student. If the student was taking the class in school, the teacher would be able to see most distractions and could take them away. During an online class, the student could be able to use their phone away from the camera and the teacher would not know. This can cause the student to not pay attention to parts of the lesson and cause them to not understand as much as they might in an in school class. The student might have other distracting factors at home that would have been controlled at school like siblings or pets. At school you can produce a more focused environment than you could by taking an online class.  Online classes have some benefits, but have too many flaws to be beneficial to students. The flaws of cheating, lack of communication between teacher and student, and distractions make online classes an ineffective method of teaching. The system of online classes could be changed to try and make it more effective, but there are too many sacrifices made when you substitute in person teaching with online teaching. ",

However, it will take six to twelve weeks for the drugs to take full effect.Your doctor may also recommend antithyroid medications to lower your TSH levels so you can take radioactive iodine to reduce your TSH levels further. You may be given radioactive iodine later and taken off the antithyroid medication.;\n, Antithyroid medications can cause serious damage to your liver and lead to a low white blood cell count. If you are allergic to these medications, you may experience symptoms like skin rashes, hives, fever, and joint pain.If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking the medication and speak to your doctor immediately.\nHave your doctor confirm you are not allergic to antithyroid medications before you take them.\n\n, Have regular check ins with your doctor to confirm your TSH levels are going down with the help of the medication. It may take one to two years for your TSH levels to go down completely while on the medication.Your doctor may also suggest that you try other treatments like radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery if your TSH levels do not go down with the medication.\n\n, You may experience remission after taking antithyroid medication for 18 to 24 months in a row. Some people experience remission within six months of taking the medication.Always follow your doctor's instructions on dosage of the antithyroid medication. Do not take more than instructed.\n\n",

        "text":" There is no one, perfect way to find out if a girl thinks you're cute, and signs that one girl likes you may be a sign from another girl that she isn't interested. The only way to get around this is to spend time with a women. The better you know her, the better you'll be able to read her and figure out if she thinks you're cute.\n\n\nShy girls often stay quiet, avoid eye contact, or maintain some distance, especially if they like a boy and are nervous he might find out.Louder, outgoing girls may act friendly or flirty with everyone, making it harder to see who they actually think is cute. The more you know her, however, the more you'll see how she treats the ones she really admires.;\n, If you can spend time alone, this is always going to be best. You cannot tell if a girl is into you if you're always off on your own, or if you're trying to judge her from afar. You need to spend quality time with her, even if it is just casual, to see how she treats you.\n\n\nSit down next to her in class or at lunch, or join her games at recess. Any time spent nearby will help show you how she feels.\nInvite her to group events, where the pressure to be together or romantic is low and you can casually see how she feels by her response to the invitation.\n\n, A big indicator of attraction is how she responds to conversations. Is she looking away, making up reasons to leave, or sitting silently whenever you're not talking? If so, chances are good she is not interested in you. However, if you give a pause or lull in the conversation and after a second or two of silence and she reengages you by asking you a question such as “where are you from?” “How about you? Do you like xyz?”, that is a sign that she wants to keep the interaction going on between you two and see where the vibe is headed unwinds. This is an important precursor to her thinking you’re cute.\n\n, Body language is not the only way to see if someone thinks you're cute, but it is a great way to gauge how someone might feel about you. Good signs include:\n\n\nTouching you, especially on the arms or back.\nSmiling frequently at you.\nMaking eye contact.\nTurning and facing you during conversations especially in group settings.\nAgreeing frequently, showing that she enjoys similar things., Teasing is one of the best ways to subtly see where her heart is at. You never want to be mean, but making jokes, having small, competitive challenges in class, at recess, or at work, and slightly making fun of her for mistakes is classic flirting. If she engages back, teasing and joking with you, there is a good chance she thinks you're cute.\n\n\nNote, however, that some people are shy and don't show their affection this way. If she doesn't joke or tease back, but still smiles and seems interested, she might still think you're cute.\n\n, If you do this, observe whether the girl pays more attention to you or her friends. If it is friends, then you know she isn't crushing on you, but if she pays more attention to you, then you know that she is crushing on you. She may try to impress you, make lots of jokes, or spend most of her time talking to you.\n\n, Find a friend you both have in common and ask their opinion. Often another friend has the outside perspective needed figure out if their is mutual attraction. Know, however, that this can quickly turn into a rumor that leaves all of your friends asking \"do you have a crush on her?\" Only ask trusted friends their advice, and keep it to a minimum., You can't control what she thinks about you, but you can control how you act around her. Be a gentleman by listening to her when she talks and offering to help her out when possible. She may not think you're cute now, but with simple, easy gestures like holding the door open or asking how she is doing each morning you can give her a great impression to remember you by.\n\n, This may be the most terrifying-seeming action in the world, but that doesn't make it any less important. The only way to really know if she thinks you're cute is to let her know you find her cute. This doesn't have to be a grand, enormous profession of love. In fact, it shouldn't be -- it should be casual and lighthearted. Let her know \"I think you're cute,\" give a light smile, and move on if she rejects you. More likely than not, however, this little complement will open her up to say how she feels as well.\n\n",

If you are anxious about meeting with your boss, you may also want to rehearse what you say to them beforehand.;\n, Whether your manager prefers to discuss routine tasks with email, in person during meetings or on the phone, learn to utilize their favorite method. Furthermore, you should observe how formal or informal they are when they communicate with you and match that style.\n\n, When you approach your boss, state how you are working and how you feel. Avoid using “you” phrases such as “you should be doing better” or “you need to ___” These sound accusing and can threaten your relationship with your boss. Instead of saying “Nobody around here plans anything. Everything is so unorganized. You should be better at giving us information,” trying stating “I am struggling with scheduling in this office. I feel as though we do not organize effectively. Is there anything I can do to help improve communication?”\n\n, A disorganized boss may give conflicting advice or cumbersome tasks. If you are confused about what you need to do, politely ask for clarification. It is best to ask as you receive the tasks. Phrase your questions in a positive light so that it doesn’t seem like you are complaining. Instead of saying “why do we have so many meetings when we don’t do anything important?” try stating it this way: “Since we’re all so busy with our work, is there any way we can have fewer but more productive meetings?”\nYou can also use “I” statements while asking. Try saying, “I was wondering which task has the highest priority for this week.”\n\n, If you have a problem, come to your boss with a few solutions already in mind. You can let your boss decide which solution will work best, but by preparing ahead of time, you are making it easy for your boss to respond to the issue.\n\n\nStart the conversation by telling your boss you have both a problem and some potential solutions. Be sure to tell them at the beginning that you want their thoughts on the matter. You can say, “I just wanted to bring an issue to your attention. I have a few possible solutions for the matter, and I wanted to run them by you.”\nIf your boss rejects your solutions, try asking what you can do instead to solve the problem. You can say, “What do you think is the best way we can handle this situation?”\n\n, When your boss does manage to give you something on time or help you, thank them. Even bosses want appreciation and praise. By showing your gratitude, not only will you increase your rapport but you will encourage your boss to continue such behavior. ",

Consequently, the electrostatic environment influences two properties\nof Majorana devices: the shape of the topological phase boundary and the\noscillations of the Majorana splitting energy. We demonstrate that both\nproperties show a non-universal behavior, and depend on the details of the\nelectrostatic environment. We show that when the wire only contains a single\nelectron mode, the experimentally accessible inverse self-capacitance of this\nmode fully captures the interplay between electrostatics and Zeeman field.

Summer projects should be student-designed it will make the students take on some responsibility  give them a sense of inclusion in their education.  The average person is in school about fourteen years. As you go through school you grow and you have to take on some responsibility. You have to do homework, projects, etc. While youre in school it is easy to accept these responsibilities, because you have a teacher and other student there to remind you of what you need to do. However, over the summer the only person there to be reminded by is yourself, and its difficult to remember something you're not interested in  By giving students the chance to design their own summer projects , you are putting them in a position to take responsibility As student we already dont have a lot of say in our education. We are taught things based off of an outline that our teacher has to follow, and we are constantly being given assignments designed by the teacher or taken from pages of a textbook. It isnt uncommon for students to complain or be aggravated about not getting much say in what they get to do school-wise. By giving students the opprotunity to design and do a project on their own gives them a chance to be involved in their education and for them to call the shots by giving students the chance to design their own summer projects you are puytting them in a position to acceot responsibility and to feel included in their education.

If you want to use it in advisory or during lunch then i don't see the big deal.  My personal opinion is the cell phone issue is blown way out of per portion  If the kid wants to check their phone really quick then let them do it.  Its not like they have their ring tone blaring or anything. Teachers all know that we remember to put them on silent.  Maybe if a student had the permission to use their phone in school from their parent. The teachers don't allow it but their guardian does. I think the issue should be resolved by parents and not by a student.  For one no one listens to us. They think were just a teenager looking for an excuse to use out phones. Well its not because maybe  some kids like to feel safe with their phone.  Its like their security to let them know their safe. Maybe their being bullied and want to talk to someone about it. And they don't want to bring the principal into it all.\n\nThey can text their mom or dad and resolve the issue. I think it is important to talk to them.

        "text":" They are designed to catch chicken droppings deposited overnight. You should clean these once each morning. This way, you minimize the amount of time the feces spends on the board before being cleaned.\n\n\nTo clean the dropping boards,put some disposable gloves on and scrape the droppings off with a taping knife. You can scrape each board directly into your compose pile, or scrape them all off into a small pail, then dump the pail on your compost pile.\nIf you see poop on the roosts, scrape them clean with your taping knife, too.;\n, If the bedding is visibly soiled or smells bad, you should dispose of it. You can compost your used chicken coop bedding like pine shavings and hay. If your bedding looks generally good and is free of odors, you can simply set it out in the sun where it will naturally dry. The sun will kill also pathogens, bacteria, and mold.You should remove any noticeably dirty bedding every morning.\n\n, Add fresh, clean bedding to the coop.If you simply took the old bedding out and allowed it to dry after removing the badly soiled bits, place the bedding back in the coop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Evaluate the condition of the bedding in your nesting boxes each morning. Replace any dirty straw or pine shavings. Add new bedding as needed.To keep your nesting boxes clean, make sure they are located at a height which is lower than your roosts. Otherwise, your chickens will roost (and poop) in the nesting boxes. For the same reason, do not position the nesting boxes directly below roosts.\n\n, If your chickens are free-range, stick them outside for a bit. If they aren't, put them in a shed or garage of some sort. Chickens cannot fly well, so you shouldn’t worry about your chickens escaping. If your chickens have had their wings clipped, they will be even less likely to fly off. Keep the gate to your yard closed and you should be fine.\n\n\nIf you have time, you can take advantage of the opportunity you have to get your chickens out of their cages. If you have a partner, you could ask them to clean the chickens while you continue to work on the coop.\n\n, You should also remove all the tools and items which might be in the coop. Your feeder, waterer, nesting boxes, and roosts (if they are removable) should all be removed and wiped down with a nontoxic household cleaner. After taking out all the bedding and other removables, go back over the floor with a broom and sweep out any bits you may have missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the ceiling for cobwebs at this point, too. Use your broom to remove any you see., You could use a power washer, though you don’t need to. Point the hose toward the floor and move it in a back-and-forth motion in order to ensure you’ve applied water to the entire surface.\n\n\nThe water will help soften up any manure or dirt that is strongly attached to the floor. Go back over these areas with a paint scraper in order to remove them.\nAllow the water to drain somewhat. If you have a coop which drains poorly, mop up the rest of the water.\n\n, Spray it on the walls if you notice spots of grime, droppings, or blood. Use a stiff-bristled brush on the areas you want to clean, and scrub them vigorously with wide, circular motions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllow the coop to dry by opening all the doors and windows. If the coop cleaner is not draining out properly, use a mop to absorb excess liquid.\n\n, DE is a fine powder made of fossilized algae called diatoms, and prevents infestations of ticks, fleas, mites, digestive worms, and other pests.With your coop’s floor dry and clean of feeders, nesting boxes, and other removable objects, sprinkle some DE across the floor of your coop. The amount you’ll need varies with the size of your coop. If you have a large coop, use a large amount. If you have a smaller coop, use a smaller amount.\n\n\nYou could sprinkle the DE with a small spoon by scooping some up and then shaking your hand back and forth over the floor, allowing a bit to spill over the edge of the spoon with each shake. Alternately, you could use a duster to apply the DE. A duster sprays the DE out when squeezed, and is useful for getting it deep in the cracks and crevices of your coop.\nEnsure you use food grade DE.\nDo not inhale the DE. It can cause inflammation of the lungs.\n\n, New bedding will complete the process of making your chicken coop a chicken home.If you chose to dry the old bedding in the sun rather than discard it entirely, you can bring it back in and replace it on the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, After you've added the bedding, put the rest of the items you removed -- such as the feeder and waterer -- back inside the coop. Refill the food and water if needed. Finally, bring your chickens back inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, While certain maintenance tasks like checking the nesting boxes, dropping boards, bedding should be checked each day and changed as needed, a full-coop cleaning can occur at various intervals. How often you choose to clean your coop top-to-bottom depends on how many chickens you have and how big your coop is. Clean your coop more often if you have many chickens in a small space. You can clean your coop less often if you have few chickens in a big coop.\n\n\nIf you detect any foul stink, especially one reeking of ammonia, your coop needs a serious cleaning.\nAlways err on the side of cleanliness when deciding whether or not your coop needs to be cleaned.\nSome coops can be cleaned as few as three times a year, while others call for cleaning every two weeks.When you get a new flock, clean your coop out before housing them within., Cleaning the chicken coop can be a dirty business. You should minimize the chances of touching something yucky by wearing disposable gloves.Not only will this keep your hands clean, but it can minimize your risk for contracting germs and illnesses like Salmonella.Disposable gloves are readily available at most gardening or housing supply stores.\nUsing disposable gloves help reduce the risk of spreading bacteria as gloves are thrown away after use.\nIf gloves become punctured during use, put a new pair on to avoid spreading bacteria.\nWash your hands with soap after exiting the chicken coop and removing your gloves.\n\n, If you do not, select your rattiest pair of sneakers and use them exclusively when cleaning the chicken coop. Remove the shoes just before you step into your house. This way, you won’t track any of the chicken coop grime into your home.\n\n, Chicken coops can collect dust that you don’t want to breathe in. If your chicken coop is mostly enclosed, the problem is compounded. No matter what type of coop you have, however, you should always put a face mask on when you enter the chicken coop.Ear loop masks of the variety worn by doctors tend to be the most comfortable, and effectively cover both mouth and nose.\nPrevent dust buildup by providing adequate ventilation for your chicken coop.\n\n, Wear old shirts and tattered jeans that you don’t mind messing up when cleaning your coop. Since you might be kneeling or brushing against the inside of your chicken coop, you should not wear clothes that you would mind getting grimy, dusty, and gross. After you’ve finished cleaning the coop, change into something clean. Wash the clothes you wore into the coop as soon as possible., There are many coop cleaners available. Only use cleaners that are nontoxic and free of ingredients like bleach and creosote. Avoid aerosol sprays as well. Try to find a cleaner that leaves behind a pleasant odor when used. You could choose a cleaner from your local farm supply store specifically designed to clean chicken coops, or you could use a household cleaner.\n\n\nIf you mix bleach and ammonia (a primary component of chicken feces), you can create toxic fumes, and irritate the lungs and eyes., There are many varieties of homemade coop cleaner, all of which contain vinegar and water as main ingredients. For example, you could easily create a pleasant-smelling lavender-mint cleaning agent by mixing half a handful of fresh mint, half a handful of fresh lavender leaves and flowers, and half of a vertically-sliced vanilla bean in a standard-size mason jar white vinegar.\n\n\nFill the jar with vinegar and stop when it is 1\/4 inch from the top. Let the jar sit for three to four weeks, shaking three times every other day.\nWhen the vinegar smell has mostly been replaced with a minty-lavender scent, strain the leaves and vanilla bean out and pour the mix into a spray bottle.An even more basic recipe calls for an equal mix of water and white vinegar., Don’t feel obligated to use just one cleaning agent when cleaning your coop. Different cleaning agents often have different strengths.For instance, one cleaner might do well against poop on the floor, while another might do well against dirt and mud. Try a variety of cleaners in order to find which work best for your coop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"At one point, I believed the electoral college was a bad idea. Although, after reading this, my view on the matter as changed dramatically.  The electoral college keeps a balance in a country, a balance very much needed. I agree with it one hundred percent.  The electoral college was established as a compromise between election of the President by congress, and election of the President by popular citizen vote. The founding fathers felt it would given congress too much power if it elected the President all by itself. They also felt if citizens chose the seat by themsleves there wouod be chaos. They decided on a nice in between; they both choose, well sort of. What many citizens do not know is that when they cast their vote, they are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President.  The problem with citizens voting diectly for the president can be broken into two categories: uncertinty  underqualification.  If the vote were solely based on citizen votes, the statisitcal outcome of the event would be crazy. With the majority of the electoral college applying the winner take all approach, it cuts those numbers down incredibly. It is allot easier to confirm a winner out of 538 votes then it is  to confirm one out of hundreds of millions of votes now isn,t it? \n Another thing that makes it hard for citizens to directlly vote for their president is being underqualified.  Many people think for themselves and only themselves. They are not qualified to make choices for the sake of the whole country, that is where the electors come in. These are people chosen by state conventions, state party committees, and sometimes candidates themselves. They hear the ideas of the people and manage them so that they are able to help everyone. They are pro politicians whose job in life is to preserve our country\n\n The electoral college is not of a democracy, but of a dictatorship.  The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.\n\n You are wrong in so many levels sir. the electoral college does not exclude democracy, it promotes it!  Every citizen of legal age uses their god given right to express their political preference in the hopes of improving our country. The electoral college prevents regional rulership over areas that prefer one political side. It re-elects every four years to let everyone know, though your thoughts may not have been used in these past times, know that they have surely been heard.  Things like the electoral college make me proud to live in the United States of America,  the greatest country in the world. ",

        "text":" Birds do wag their tails, just like other pets. The bird will wag it back and forth. Generally, this gesture means the bird is happy., If you're nearby and he comes to you, that's a sign he's happy you're there. However, he's only happy if his head is up as he walks to you, rather than pointing face-down., While generally not a gesture, cockatiels like to talk when they are happy. They will sing to themselves or whistle. They'll also make little chirping noises., If your cockatiel's eyes suddenly dilate, that could be a sign he's getting mad. Stop what you're doing if you see this warning sign., When he's really angry, he may put his head down. He may also ruffle up his feathers, and fan his tail feathers.If he starts walking toward you in this position, he really wants you out of the way., This stance, paired with spread wings, is usually a sign he's trying to defend his territory. It's probably time to back away if he's making this stance while you're near the cage., Cockatiels will lunge at you if they are about to bite. They may also snap in your direction with their beak. You should leave him alone for a bit if he's trying to snap at you., While hissing is not a gesture, it does go hand-in-hand with other aggressive behavior, such as lunging. If you hear your cockatiel hiss, he may be about to bite., Wing flapping, when the bird makes an expansive gesture with his wings and moves them up and down, is usually a sign he's mad or annoyed. Try to leave him alone for a bit, if you've been bothering him., Some cockatiels, usually males, will bang their beaks against things, such as counter tops and cages. The idea is to be noticed, usually by whatever or whoever has become their love interest.Cockatiels can fall in love with objects, their own reflection, other birds, and even you.\nHe may also whistle or lean towards the person or item., Hopping is similar to beak banging; he's looking for attention. However, hopping is taking it to the next level from beak banging. He's really begging for attention., Sometimes, in coordination with other behaviors, cockatiels will make loud squawking or screaming noises. Basically, the cockatiel is looking for attention., Head snaking is when the bird moves his head from side to side. It's a fluid motion, not jerking. Usually, the bird is just asking to be noticed., When a cockatiel is trying to attract a mate, he may let the feathers on the top of his head curl up into a crest. Basically, it creates a little curlicue on the top of his head.However, he could also be defending his territory with this gesture.\n\n, Another sign of seduction is the fanning of the tail feathers, paired with the cresting of the head feathers and the spreading out the wings. He may also strut around and whistle.Again, this gesture could also be a sign he's defending his territory.\n\n, Sometimes, when a cockatiel is sick, he will bob his tail. If you notice this sign, it may be time to take him to the vet., Another indicator your bird could be sick is that he sits. He'll either hunch down on the perch or sit on the bottom of the cage., While these signs aren't necessarily \"gestures,\" they can also indicate sickness. For instance, your bird may sneeze, get extra sleepy, or lose his voice. He may also may eat more or less, or he may suddenly drink more water. Finally, his droppings may change in appearance (color) or number.",

        "text":"Arlington Heights is a neighborhood in Central Los Angeles, California.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigin\nIn July 1904, the Los Angeles Evening Express reported the sale of a sixty acre tract known as Arlington Heights for the price of $75,000.  The parcel fronted Pico Street and Washington Streets with the Sixteenth Street car line running through the tract. It noted that the property was to be sub-divided and the streets \"finely improved\". By 1906, sub-divided lots were listed with selling prices from $995 to $2900.\n\nIn 1910, the Arlington Heights Improvement Association announced that they spent $16,000 to purchase 10 lots (between Washington and Eighteenth Street) to put up a school that would cost an additional $25,000.\n\nDemolition Threat\nIn February 1988, Mount Vernon Junior High was considering an expansion that would have torn down 29 homes in the neighborhood.  At that time, the Los Angeles Times described Arlington Heights as an \"Inner City Oasis\".  The school district was considering one of two options: demolition of existing homes or adding new stories to existing buildings.  The following month, the Times reported that the expansion plan had been shelved and homes would not be taken.  Homeowners said that they  still planned to seek historic status for their homes to prevent future condemnation should the district change position.\n\nRenaming of Mount Vernon Junior High\nIn the 1990s, there was a movement to rename Mount Vernon Junior High after Wyatt Earp of O.K. Corral fame. The school is located on the site of the gunfighter’s last home at 4004 W. 17th Street. At the time, then-councilman Nate Holden said “I like the sound of ‘Wyatt Earp Junior High.’”\nHolden's proposal ran into opposition and was later dropped. In 2006, the school was renamed after attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and 17th Street was rechristened as Johnnie Cochran Vista. Cochran had attended Mount Vernon and had been a member of the debating team.\n\nGeography\nPer Council File: 02-2353, adopted on October 30, 2002, the City of Los Angeles defined Arlington Heights as the area bounded by the west side of Arlington Avenue, the east side of Crenshaw Boulevard, the north side of Washington Boulevard and the south side of Pico Boulevard.   At that time, The Los Angeles Department of Transportation was instructed to install neighborhood signs at the following locations:  Arlington and Pico Boulevard (southwest corner), Arlington Avenue and Washington Boulevard (northeast corner), Crenshaw and Washington Boulevards (northeast corner), Crenshaw and Venice Boulevards (southeast corner), Crenshaw and Pico Boulevards (southeast corner),  Arlington Avenue and Venice Boulevard (northwest corner).\n\nThe neighborhood of Country Club Park is located north of Pico Boulevard.  Angelus Vista is located east of Arlington Avenue. The neighborhoods of Victoria Park and Lafayette Square are located west of Crenshaw Boulevard. West Adams Terrace is to the south.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times Mapping L.A.project definition of Arlington Heights includes the adjacent neighborhoods of Country Club Park, Western Heights and Angelus Vista.\n\nPopulation\nThe following statistics apply only to the area defined by the Los Angeles Times Mapping L.A. project:\n\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 22,096 residents in the 1.03-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 21,423 people per square mile, among the highest population densities in the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 23,330. The median age for residents was 31, about average for both the city and the county.\n\nArlington Heights was said to be \"highly diverse\" when compared to the city at large. The ethnic breakdown in 2000 was: Latinos, 56.6%; blacks, 24.5%; Asians, 12.9%; whites, 4.7%;  and others, 1.2%. Mexico (34,9%) and El Salvador (20.2%) were the most common places of birth for the 49.8% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that was considered high in comparison with foreign-born in the city as a whole.\n\nThe median household income in 2008 dollars was $31,421, considered low for both the city and the county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large. The household size of three people was just about average for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 81.6% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.\n\nThe percentages of never-married men (42.4%) and never-married women (35.9%) were among the county's highest. The census found 1,165 families headed by single parents, the 23.5% rate being considered high for both the city and the county.\n\nArlington Heights residents aged 25 and older holding a four-year degree amounted to 13.9% of the population in 2000, about average for both the city and the county, although there was a high percentage of residents with less than a high school diploma.\n\nHistoric-Cultural Monuments\n\n Original building for the Washington Irving branch library - 1802 South Arlington Avenue.

        "text":"Maxwell Lord IV is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in Justice League #1 (May 1987) and was created by Keith Giffen, J. M. DeMatteis, and Kevin Maguire. Maxwell Lord was originally introduced as a shrewd and powerful businessman who was an ally of the Justice League and was influential in the formation of the Justice League International, but he later developed into an adversary of Wonder Woman and the Justice League.\n\nThe character made his cinematic debut in the 2020 DC Extended Universe film, Wonder Woman 1984, portrayed by Pedro Pascal.\n\nFictional character biography \nMaxwell Lord IV is the son of Maxwell Lord III, a successful businessman and head of the Chimtech Consortium. Maxwell III set out to be a good example for his son by striving to always do what was right. When Maxwell IV was 16, he came home to find his father dead in an apparent suicide. His father had discovered that his company had produced a highly carcinogenic product, and could not bear the guilt.\n\nLord's mother was convinced by her husband to employ a similar practice, cajoling heroic metahumans to help Lord. Thus, he sparked the plans to bring the Justice League, leaderless and broken after the Crisis on Infinite Earths event, under his exclusive control.\n\nGiffen and DeMatteis years \nLord initially works behind the scenes to establish the Justice League, while under the control of a computer created by the Metron. The computer wanted Lord to set up a worldwide peacekeeping organization as part of its plan to dominate the world.\n\nA later retcon changed his controller to the villainous computer program Kilg%re (pronounced Kilgore), which had taken over Metron's machine. A much later retcon mitigated the Kilg%re's and Metron's influence, stating that Lord already had plans for taking over the League, and that he would have pursued them regardless.\n\nLord's ruthlessness at this time is illustrated when he sets up a disturbed would-be terrorist as a villain for the League to defeat, resulting in the man's death. Later, Lord rebels against the computer's influence and destroys it.\n\nOnce free of the computer's influence, Lord is portrayed as an amoral businessman, but not a real villain. During the time that Giffen and DeMatteis were writing the Justice League, Lord is shown struggling with his conscience and developing heroic qualities, though he would remain a con-artist.\n\nFrom Invasion! to Identity Crisis \nOriginally a normal human, Lord is one of many people on Earth gifted with superpowers during the Invasion crossover, when a Gene Bomb is exploded by alien invaders. This bomb activates Lord's latent metagene, granting him the ability to control the minds of others, albeit at great difficulty. Despite being a metahuman, Lord never identifies as one. Instead, at the urging of his mother to act for the benefit of non-metahumans, he shifts his hatred for the generic \"authority figures\" who caused his father's death to the metahuman community.\n\nAfter he is shot and placed in a coma at the beginning of JLAmerica\/JLEurope crossover Breakdowns, Supervillain Dreamslayer takes over Lord's body and supercharges Lord's power, allowing him to control thousands of minds at once. Using Lord's body and power, Dreamslayer almost forces the Justice League International (JLI) to disband. While possessed Lord forces the JLI to battle itself, the mortally wounded Silver Sorceress manages to contain Dreamslayer, and holds him within her mind as she dies, taking him with her. When Lord is freed, his power is burnt out.\n\nLater, Lord is diagnosed with a brain tumor and dies. Kilg%re however, had been waiting for the right moment to reactivate its control of Lord. Kilg%re downloads Lord's consciousness into a duplicate of one of Dreamslayer's allies, Extremist cyborg Lord Havok (in a further retcon the body is said to be a New Genesis-built automaton). In this form, he spends some time testing the League's capabilities and takes control of the secret organization the Arcana. The cyborg body later shifts to resemble his original human form.\n\nDoomsday later crash lands on Earth, easily trounces the League and kills Superman. With Earth undefended, world-conqueror Mongul invades and destroys Coast City killing Lord's mother. This event further fuels his hatred and paranoia against the metahumans, as well as leading him to believe that not only can metahumans not be trusted, but that their personal battles and scuffles are enough to shatter world safety.\n\nLord puts together several former JLI members, including L-Ron, Captain Atom, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, and Fire as the \"Super Buddies\", advertised as \"heroes the common man could call\". These stories are told in the six-issue miniseries Formerly Known as the Justice League in 2003, and its 2005 sequel, I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League.\n\nIn Brad Meltzer's Identity Crisis (2004), Lord attends Sue Dibny's funeral and speaks to Booster Gold, further denting his already dwindling faith in superheroes.\n\nInfinite Crisis \n\nThe 2005 80-page one-shot Countdown to Infinite Crisis reveals that Lord is no longer a cyborg, and is apparently a criminal mastermind who spent years running the JLI while gathering sensitive information about the world's superheroes, whom he considered a threat to the planet. Simultaneously, he sabotaged JLI efforts to render the superhero team as ineffectual as possible. At the end of the prologue special issue, he shoots and kills one-time JLI member, Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle, when the hero discovers Lord's secret and refuses to join Lord.\n\nDuring this time, Alexander Luthor Jr., the god-like son of Lex Luthor from an alternate Earth, gives Lord control over Batman's Brother Eye, a satellite system Batman created to monitor all superhuman contact. Lord uses Brother Eye to create an army of OMACs (humans infected with a nano-virus that transformed them into cyborgs), programmed to hunt down and kill all superhumans.\n\nLord also uses his powers to influence Superman's mind, causing him to brutally beat Batman in the belief that he is Brainiac. Lord subsequently sends Superman to attack Wonder Woman after making him believe that she is his old enemy Doomsday who has just killed his wife Lois Lane. Lord justifies the resulting destruction as proof of his argument about the dangers of superhumans, pointing out the devastation that Wonder Woman and Superman could cause if they fought in a crowded area, and arguing that the fact that Superman can be brought under another's control is evidence that superhumans cannot be relied upon. In the midst of her battle with Superman, Diana realizes that even if she defeats him, he would still remain under Lord's absolute mental control. She creates a diversion lasting long enough for her to race back to Lord's location and asks that he release Superman. Lord, bound by her lasso of truth, complies but states that he'll use Superman again to kill people. When she demands to know how to free Superman from Lord's control, Lord replies \"Kill me.\" Wonder Woman then snaps his neck. Brother Eye broadcasts the footage of Wonder Woman killing Lord all over the world, destroying her reputation and her friendship with Batman and Superman, who reject her despite the fact that she saved their lives. As the crisis unfolds, the three eventually reconcile as Diana helps Superman talk down his other self and prevents Batman from shooting Alexander Luthor Jr., accepting that Diana did what she had to do and acknowledging that, for all their differences, they all still want justice.\n\nAt the \"Crisis Counseling\" panel at Wizard World Chicago, Dan DiDio explained DC's reasoning in using Lord's character in Infinite Crisis. After going through several possible characters who could be the \"new leader for the offshoot of Checkmate\", Maxwell Lord was suggested. Many of the editors thought that the idea made sense, as Lord had been shown to have a mean streak and to have killed previously. The idea was dropped due to the continuity errors, such as him being a cyborg, but they went back to it later after deciding none of the other possible characters were suitable. Didio explained: \"We thought about that aspect of the story [where Maxwell was turned into a cyborg] some more. And then asked, 'Did anyone read it?' No. 'Did anyone like the idea?' No. So we moved ahead with Max as being a human, and having been a human, and not letting that small part of the past stand in the way of this story. We wanted what was best for Countdown [to Infinite Crisis], and for us, that meant that Max had to be a human\".\n\nOne Year Later \n\nLord reappeared in 2007 in the first two-story arcs of the new Booster Gold series by Geoff Johns and Dan Jurgens. At the end of the 52 Pick-Up story arc, Booster Gold and Blue Beetles from the past, present and future go back in time to Countdown to Infinite Crisis and prevent Lord from killing Ted Kord. In the subsequent Blue and Gold story arc, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold discover that, in saving Ted Kord, they have created a new timeline where Lord was never killed by Wonder Woman and Lord's OMACs, and that a mind-controlled Superman has turned the entire planet into a police state. Lord reveals that he had been returned to human form after dozens of clandestine operations and that he learned the importance of control during that time. When Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, having assembled their old JLI teammates, storm Brother Eye, Lord is killed by Dr. Light when she blasts a hole through his chest. Ted Kord realizes that his death is the only way to fix the timestream and leaves the battle, seemingly to return to the past and accept his death.\n\nLord next makes an appearance in the Trinity maxi-series (2008-9). Lord's skull is stolen by a group called the Dreambound and brought to Morgaine Le Fey for usage in a spell, which requires an item connected to Wonder Woman.\n\nBlackest Night \n\nDuring the Blackest Night (2009–10) storyline, Maxwell Lord is identified as one of the deceased people entombed below the Hall of Justice. Lord's corpse is revived as a Black Lantern during the event. Targeting Wonder Woman, he lures her to Arlington National Cemetery with a trail of slaughtered bodies. When Wonder Woman arrives, he springs a trap, using black rings to revive the bodies of fallen soldiers. Wonder Woman uses her lasso to reduce Lord and the soldiers to dust, but as she leaves, the dust begins to regenerate.<ref>Blackest Night: Wond#1 (February 20)<\/ref> Some time later, Lord resumes his attack on Wonder Woman, who had recently been deputized as a Star Sapphire. Wonder Woman encases Lord's body in a violet crystal, then shatters it to pieces. Lord continues to taunt her, speaking out of a piece of crystal. He is later brought back to life by the power of the White Light. Though Guy Gardner attempts to restrain him, Lord uses his mind control abilities to make Guy let him leave.\n\n Brightest Day \nLord is among the other resurrected heroes\/villains featured in the Brightest Day (2010) series. He is first seen attempting to push his mind control powers further than ever, but severely injures himself in the attempt, despite his meticulous preparations, which include a constant blood supply and an ice pool. Later, Deadman's white power ring gives him a vision where Lord is shown shaking hands with Jaime Reyes, the third Blue Beetle. However, in this vision, Lord is hiding a gun behind his back, implying that Lord is planning to kill Reyes, just as Lord killed Reyes' predecessor, Ted Kord.\n\nIn the first issue of Justice League: Generation Lost, Lord is the subject of an unprecedented international manhunt. He is found hiding in the old Justice League International embassy by Booster Gold, whom Lord is able to defeat. Lord then uses a device to amplify his mind control powers to unprecedented levels. With these, he erases the world's memory of his existence. Initially, it appears that only his former Justice League colleagues Booster Gold, Ice, Fire, and Captain Atom remember Max. It is later revealed in Brightest Day #8 that Deadman also remembers his existence. Lord uses his powers to disgrace the team, having Fire ousted from Checkmate, Captain Atom turned in as a fugitive for betraying the U.S. Army, and Ice isolated from Guy Gardner, who Lord causes to believe that she tried to kill him. He also influences the superhero community into believing Ted Kord committed suicide, which enrages Booster Gold. He then sends OMACs after the current Blue Beetle, Jaime Reyes, who calls Booster Gold and the others for help. Meanwhile, Lord discovers that his resurrection has come with a side effect: some of his efforts to control others' minds transform his targets into cadavers wearing Black Lantern uniforms. Contacting his former colleagues through a fallen Rocket Red's armor, Lord reveals that he intentionally exempted them from the worldwide mindwipe, and that he wants them to protect the world as they did in the old days. He then warns the group not to come looking for him, unaware that Blue Beetle had located his transmission signal.\n\nCaptain Atom tells the others that an explosion, seen in Brightest Day #1, propelled him briefly into the 24th century, where he saw a world reduced to a pre-industrial state by a metahuman war instigated by Lord. The team resolves to try to prevent Lord from bringing about this dystopia. Maxwell Lord is at one point contacted by the Entity, who tells him to stop Magog from plunging the world into war. Lord then sees a vision of himself, with Magog's staff, killing a distraught Magog, who begs for mercy. The Entity gives Lord a vision of a possible future where Magog's team attacks Parasite. In this vision, Parasite's absorption of Captain Atom causes an explosion that destroys everything within a large radius and annihilates over a million people (similar to the Kingdom Come future). Also, Power Girl witnesses her new enemy C.R.A.S.H. confronting Lord before heading towards the teleporter.\n\nWhen the team next encounters Lord, after mind-controlling first Fire and then Booster Gold to prevent them from stopping him, he teleports from the old JLI embassy back to Checkmate, where he attempts to enlist Magog to kill Captain Atom. Lord uses technology to upgrade Magog's staff into emitting energy blasts. Meanwhile, Lord asks Professor Ivo to reprogram the Metal Men. He then asks Doctor Sivana to create a genetically engineered humanoid clone of Power Girl.\n\nWhen Captain Atom and Magog battle in the heart of Chicago, Captain Atom is able to convince Magog that he's being used, and Magog remembers Lord. Lord uses his powers to force Magog to kill himself. He then makes everyone believe that they watched Captain Atom murder Magog. The Entity proclaims that Lord has completed his task, and his life is restored to him. After briefly receiving a White Ring, the recently returned Bruce Wayne seems to be aware of Max Lord's resurrection. When Captain Atom absorbs the energy from Magog's spear, he is propelled forward through time to 112 years in the future, where Lord, while long dead, has plunged humanity into a massive metahuman war ruled by OMACs. Captain Atom is eventually returned to the present, but not before a dying Power Girl tells him that the catalyst for all this was Wonder Woman's death by Lord's hand. Also, Batman (Damian Wayne) tells him how to stop Lord's ultimate plans. However, Lord is struck with the discovery that, with the exception of the original four ex-JLI members, no one in the world remembers Wonder Woman.\n\nLater, when the Creature Commandos attack the JLI embassy, Lord poses as a member. He captures Jaime Reyes, and heads towards the teleporter with him, while the others are unable to stop him. Lord regains his abilities to transform his targets into cadaver OMACs, and he tortures the captive Blue Beetle. Lord's mindwipes feed off psychic energy, so the more people who are around, the faster some of them will forget. In issue #19, the rest of the team locates Lord's secret facility in a submersible below the Sea of Japan. Seconds before the team reaches him, and as predicted by the White Ring, Lord shoots Jaime in the head (echoing his execution of Jaime's predecessor, Ted Kord). The JLI arrives and attacks Lord, but he escapes from the JLI in one of his headquarters' escape pods, and the headquarters vanishes.\n\nWhile the JLI learns Jaime is alive, the team also learns that Lord not only manipulated them, but also wanted the JLI to chase him to distract Checkmate. Later, Lord uses a device to enhance his mental powers, turning people around the world into OMACs to attack Wonder Woman and the JLI. Before the device activates, Lord sends the OMAC Prime that he controls to attack the heroes. Booster Gold manages to locate Lord's flying headquarters, attacking it to confront him face-to-face. Lord gains the upper hand with his mental powers, but Captain Atom grabs him, after having become overloaded with quantum energy in the fight with OMAC Prime and about to be pulled into the timestream. Atom threatens to take Lord with him unless Lord undoes the global mindwipe, and a desperate Lord complies. Captain Atom is pulled away and Lord teleports to escape from the heroes. Later, he posts an online video where he blames Professor Ivo for Magog's rampage. He also says that he only wants to protect the world from the metahuman threat, and he will continue to do so in secret.\n\n The New 52 \nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. Max Lord still runs Checkmate as the Black King, but now has leadership seniority over Cadmus and its programs. He successfully captures Batman's superpower monitoring satellite, Brother Eye, for his own purposes, but it ends up creating an agent with which it would act through seeking vengeance. Lord ends up getting into heated battle with an all new OMAC who was formerly one of the project's employees.\n\n DC Rebirth \nStill the running head of Checkmate during DC Rebirth, Lord assembles a team consisting of Doctor Polaris, Emerald Empress, Johnny Sorrow, Rustam of Prime Earth, and Lobo to assist him in his efforts to take down Amanda Waller. He chose these five as they were the 'original' incarnation of the Suicide Squad, and hence have experience working as a team, prompting Waller to capture the Justice League to ask for their help against Lord. While most of the heroes and villains do not recognize Lord, the displaced pre-Flashpoint Superman shows awareness of him, reflecting on his past contact with Lord before reality was reset.\n\nAlthough the combined forces of the League and the Squad are able to defeat Lord's allies, they are unable to prevent Lord from achieving his goal; with the aid of a controlled Killer Frost, Lord acquires the Heart of Darkness from a vault, using it to enhance his powers to \"infect\" (take control of) the League. Lord uses the infected Justice League (apart from Batman, who Lord did not infect) to achieve \"peace\" across America, and has Waller kidnapped and taken before him. However, despite believing that he had taken precautions to control the Heart, Lord is forced by Waller to recognize that it is manipulating his perceptions, using Lord's powers to spread chaos and evil across the world, and twisting Lord's perception of what is transpiring. When Waller is able to bring him to his senses, Lord tries to remove the Heart of Darkness, but it consumes him and transforms him into Eclipso. Eclipso is driven out of Lord when Killer Frost is able to use her powers to create a prism of ice, channeling Superman's heat vision at just the right frequency to disrupt Lord's hold on his slaves, with Lord subsequently being immobilized by Killer Frost. Lord awakens in a cell specially designed to hold him, with injectors pumping so much blood thinner into him that he would bleed to death if he attempted to access his powers. He mockingly asks Waller if she set this whole thing up just to 'justify' the Squad to the League, but Waller declines to reply, and simply informs him that he is to prepare himself for service on \"Task Force XI\".\n\nLord later works under the supervision of Wonder Woman to stop his dangerous technology from threatening innocent people.\n\n Powers and abilities \nIn his original depictions, Maxwell Lord had no abilities, but later became a metahuman as a result of the Dominators' invasion of Earth. Lord's powers allow him to telepathically influence people's minds, typically in the form of pushing a subconscious suggestion to others. Using his power causes Max's nose to bleed, and requires great mental strain. Over time, Lord's powers grew to the point where he could take full control of other beings, even Superman, although it required a great deal of time and patience for him to establish the necessary level of control over the Man of Steel. His powers made him such a threat to global security that Wonder Woman was forced to kill him after questioning him under the Lasso of Truth confirmed that his death was the only way to free Superman.\n\nWhen the character was resurrected, following Blackest Night, in the story Justice League: Generation Lost, he prepared to erase the world's memories of his past criminal actions; to survive the trauma to his brain, he placed his body in a large tub of ice and hooked himself up to a blood transfusion machine. The life entity somehow changed his abilities and would initially convert living people into the corpses of a Black Lantern. With his task completed, Lord was now fully restored, he then exhibited voluntary activation and control over every resting O.M.A.C. infected within the global populace.\n\nFollowing a company-wide reboot, Lord was reintroduced as part of the DC Rebirth publishing event, now having been a metahuman since his youth. His primary power is tweaked to a form of powerful psychic persuasion which works best when paired with a vocal command. In this later depiction, his powers work by exploiting and promoting people's underlying desires and inhibitions to make them do his bidding. His power does not give him outright control over them, as he can only push them to act on their own subconscious wants. For example, he could draw out Deadshot's subconscious desire to kill his daughter so that he could be free to kill anyone, but when he used his power on Killer Frost, he only drew out her desire to make a difference.\n\nOther versions\nEarth One\nIn Wonder Woman: Earth One, Maxwell Lord is an expert entrepreneur who provides his services to the US Army in areas such as robotics, tactical analysis and psychology. He was the main expert against alleged plans of an Amazon invasion and domination of the men of the world by women. He is also the mind behind the Project A.R.E.S.\nIt is subsequently revealed that he is actually the modern disguise of Ares.\n\nAmalgam Comics\nIn the Amalgam Comics universe, Lord is mixed with Cameron Hodge to form Lord Maxwell Hodge.\n\nElseworlds\nIn the Elseworlds tale Justice Riders, Lord is reimagined as a villainous 19th Century railroad baron who employs Felix Faust.\n\nIn other media\nTelevision\n Maxwell Lord appears in the Justice League Unlimited episode \"Ultimatum\", voiced by Tim Matheson. This version is a member of Project Cadmus and the human manager of the Ultimen, a team of genetically-engineered superheroes who operate independently of the Justice League.\n Maxwell Lord appears in the ninth season of Smallville, portrayed by Gil Bellows. Introduced in the episode \"Charade\", this version is the Black King of Checkmate who possesses the ability to extract memories from others, which he uses in an attempt to determine \"The Blur's\" identity. While he is thwarted by Clark Kent, Lord escapes, only to be apprehended by Checkmate's mysterious Red Queen. In the episode \"Hostage\", Lord kidnaps and interrogates Tess Mercer in a mental illusion to try to find the Book of Rao. However, she intentionally gives him incorrect information that eventually allows her to escape so she can move the book. Following this, Lord is incapacitated by the Red Queen for his failure.\n Maxwell Lord appears in the first season of Supergirl, portrayed by Peter Facinelli. This version is the founder of Lord Technologies and the son of scientists who were killed due to unsafe conditions, making him distrustful of all government agencies, who possesses a god complex. Seeking to expose Supergirl's identity, he uses her DNA to turn a comatose girl into a Bizarro version of her to frame and kill the real one. However, Supergirl and Alex Danvers defeat the clone while Lord is arrested by the Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO), though they later release him in return for his help in freeing Supergirl from the Black Mercy's effects. Following this, he creates a synthetic form of Kryptonite to cure Supergirl after she is exposed to Red Kryptonite he had created to stop Non's impending invasion before secretly giving General Lane some of it.\n Maxwell Lord appears in the DC Super Hero Girls episode \"#WorldsFinest\", voiced by P. J. Byrne. This version is a public relations specialist.\n\nFilm\n Maxwell Lord was meant to appear in Justice League: Mortal, portrayed by Jay Baruchel. This version, named Jonah Wilkes, was abducted as a child and given psychic abilities by the US government as part of the OMAC Project.\n Maxwell \"Max\" Lord appears in Wonder Woman 1984'', portrayed by Pedro Pascal as an adult, Lambro Demetriou as a child, and John Barry as a teenager. Born Maxwell Lorenzano, this version grew up poor, was abused by his father, picked on by bullies, and bootstrapped himself on the idea of image and publicized promises. By 1984, he became an aspiring businessman, the owner of the company Black Gold, and father to a son named Alistair (portrayed by Lucian Perez). While seeking out the Dreamstone, an artifact created by the Duke of Deception that grants users one wish while extracting a heavy toll unless they renounce their wish or destroy the stone, he manipulates Barbara Ann Minerva into helping him acquire it and grants himself the stone's powers to save his failing company and grant others' wishes in exchange for whatever he desires. Over time, he rapidly rises to power and becomes an influential figure while unknowingly causing international chaos and self-inflicted mental and physical distress. After learning of and utilizing a satellite system to grant wishes around the world and restore his health, he is confronted by Wonder Woman, who eventually convinces him to renounce his original wish. Following this, Lord comes to terms with his flaws and reunites with Alistair, promising to be a better father to him.\n\nReferences \n\nCharacters created by J. M.

A wide range of surveys are considered: SPT-SZ, SPTpol, and\nSPT-3G from the South Pole Telescope; SO-Baseline and SO-Goal configurations\nfor Simons Observatory; CMB-S4's wide area (S4-Wide) and deep (S4-Ultra deep)\nsurveys; and the futuristic CMB-HD experiment. We find that the noise from tSZ\nsignals has a significant impact on CMB-HD and to some extent on S4-Ultra deep.\nFor other experiments, the effect is negligible as the noise in the tSZ map is\ndominated by residual foregrounds or experimental noise. In the limit when the\nnoise from tSZ signals is important, we find that removing the detected\nclusters and rerunning the cluster finder allows us to find a new set of less\nmassive and distant clusters. Since the detected clusters are the dominant\nsource of the tSZ power, removing them reduces the power at $\\ell=3000$ by:\n$\\times5$ for CMB-HD; $\\times3.1$ of S4-Ultra deep; $\\times2.4$ for S4-Wide and\nSPT-3G; $\\times1.5$ for SO-Goal and SPTpol; $\\times1.35$ for SO-Baseline; and\n$\\times1.08$ for SPT-SZ.

Other people can tell other people faces if they are not being truthful. I know that technology can solve anything but we made them we program them thats why technology can detect our emotions, that means that technology is not the one who is telling our emotion its humans.\n Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not right because this emotion is private for other people  technology should stay away from other peoples business.

        "text":" The collar will be a new experience and sensation for your cat, so it will be important to choose a time of day when she will be a little less resistant to having the collar put on. You could try putting it on during her meal time or play time, when she will be distracted with another activity.You could also choose a time when she is calm, such as when you are spending quiet time with her., Place the collar on the ground near your cat so that she can get used to it before you put it around her neck. To help her get more comfortable with the collar, you can put her own scent on it. To do this, you can rub the collar on your cat’s bedding.You can also rub a soft cloth around your cat’s mouth (if she will let you) and then rub this cloth on the collar.The collar may not seem so foreign and strange to her if she recognizes her own scent on it.\n\n\nYou could also purchase a synthetic pheromone spray at your local pet store and spray this on your cat’s collar.Do not rush your cat’s investigation of the collar.\n\n, When your cat is calm and content, slowly and gently place the collar around her neck. Talk to her in a soothing and reassuring voice while you are putting the collar on to make the experience as comfortable as possible for her. Give her a treat when you have the collar on so that she can begin to make a positive association with wearing it.Your cat will probably fidget with, or scratch at, the collar and try to get it off the first time that you put it on.The first time that you put the collar on, leave it on for a few minutes then take it off.Put the collar on your cat each day, leaving it on for longer and longer each time.Your cat may need some time before she’s more comfortable with wearing the collar all day.\nConsider giving her a treat each time that she has the collar on and doesn’t try to get it off. Eventually, she will get used to the collar being on without needing a reward.\nIf she manages to get the collar off on her own, put it back on but do not give her a treat—she may think that she is being rewarded for getting the collar off.\n\n, It is very important to make sure that your cat’s collar does not fit too tightly or loosely around her neck. You will know that the collar fits correctly if you can snugly yet comfortably slide two to three fingers between the collar and your cat’s neck.Your cat may tense her neck when she has the collar on for the first time, so you may need to wait a few minutes until she relaxes her neck muscles before testing the fit.Do not put pull or tug on the collar when you are sliding fingers under it.\nIf the collar does not fit correctly the first time, remove it from your cat and adjust it accordingly.\n\n, Your cat may lose or gain weight as she gets older.If significant enough, her weight changes could cause her collar to become too loose or too tight. If you notice that her collar is hanging loosely around her neck or seems to be squeezing her neck, take it off and make the necessary readjustment.\n\n, When you walk into your local pet store, you will notice that there are many types of cat collars from which you can choose. Despite the many choices, keep in mind that safety is the most important feature of any cat collar.Breakaway collars are considered to be the safest type of collar for cats, since they will automatically open up if your cat accidentally gets her collar stuck on something (e.g., window blinds, furniture).Breakaway collars will typically have a fastener that will automatically unclasp with enough pressure.\nSome collars come with attachments, such as bells. Although these attachments can be useful for an outdoor cat (e.g., alerting potential prey to the cat’s presence), they can also get caught or stuck on things, which could be dangerous for your cat., Before you purchase the collar, run your fingers along the entirety of the collar. It should not have any rough or sharp edges that could irritate your cat’s skin. You should also check to see if the stitching has started to unravel. If the collar has a fastener, make sure that the fastener does not have any sharp edges when fastened.Consider testing the strength of the fastener before leaving the store. Pull on the collar with varying amounts of pressure. The fastener should release with a moderate amount of pressure. If it releases with barely any pressure at all, then your cat could slip out of the collar too easily.The amount of pressure needed to release the fastener will depend on your cat’s weight and size.For example, a heavy cat would probably need a fastener that releases with more pressure than would be necessary for a light cat.\n\n, Some cat collars will have a section of elastic fabric woven into them, which would stretch to the point where your cat could get out of the collar if it gets stuck on something.However, elastic collars can serious injury to your cat if she happens to get her leg stuck through it.Elastic collars also have the potential to get stuck over your cat’s jaw, which can cause serious injury.\n\n\nIf you choose an elastic collar and it gets stuck on your cat in a way that causes injury, take your cat to your veterinarian immediately for treatment.",

Whatever the situation is, how does seeking multiple opinions from different people help someone make a better choice? it can benefit you to seek multiple opinions different people can give you their own experiences and examples from their own lives help give you more options to help solve your issue can find you a more rational, mature response through the different people you seek advice from  a benefit of seeking advice from multiple people was shown by Psychologist Generic_Name, at the University of Thomas Ridge who stated that: \"It has been shown that seeking advice and opinions from multiple people has often resulted that they too have had a similar situation, and are able to personally tell you how it had ended up, and what response they took that had either resulted in negative or positive consequences. what this means is that seeking advice for more than one person can benefit you into finding a person who had been in a similar, if not the exact same, situation that you are in, and can give you efficient, accurate, first hand examples, or solutions to avoid the negative consequences all together.\n Psychologist Generic_Name, in the University of Washington Observers, claimed that: \"Seeking a solution to an issue should require more than one opinion. The reason I say this is that when dealing with major issues having a sense of choice is very important. Being limited of options causes a stress that there is really only one valid option. Discussing an issue with only one person can make you feel that way. Which is why seeking the opinion of multiple people can give you the courtesy of responding to that issue the best way you see fit with the opinions you have been given. What this basically means is that, seeking the opinion from a variety of different people can ensure that you have many solutions to work with.

Seeking multiple opinion can help you avoid the pressure that you are only allowed that one solution you have received. an article called: Seeking Proper Advice. Member Generic_Name argued that when a problem or situation occurs it is best to seek more than one opinion. His reasoning for his claim is that the more people you ask for advice the more likely you're going to find somebody who is mature, and rational. As a result their response will most likely mirror their personality. Giving you mature and rational advice in your situation. He stated that this method is often showed as a recourse to receive nothing but the best advice. Most major problems arent an easy fix, but with a mature and rational response, it will surely make an impact on seeking the right path to your situation.\" seeking the opinion of multiple people can help benefit you in many different ways such as opinions of those who have had situations that are similar to your own, a way to avoid the pressure of only having one opinion to turn to as a solution, and the opportunity to find an opinion that is both rational and mature. It is important to know the benefits of seeking the opinion of a variety of different people. I can ensure that there will be a time where you will need to seek a choice in an issue, and I only hope you turn to the people around you for their opinion, as a sense that it can truly benefit what path is taken to a positive solution with minor negative consequences. ",

For example in the tex it states that \" formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth\". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.  Finally,\n\nwhy people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it\n\n\" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years\". They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true. For example\" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence\". The people that think taht it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says  In conclusion you should believe that the face is a natural landform is because aliens isn't real.",

        "text":" You may think that you should watch the ball when your player you are defending doesn't have the ball. Don't do that. A part about defense is watching the forwards on the other team, for clues of where the ball is. You can't have anyone get the open slip on you. Once the ball's behind you, it's gone. Always keep your eyes on those forwards.;\n, You need to talk as a team to know who is marking who and know what to do. Communication is especially important if you have a main defensive role, like centre back or goalkeeper. If there is a new guy, talk to get him up to what is happening; don't let the other team have an advantage over your new guy.\n\n, Try to stay in the carrier's space.\n\n, If the ball is on their side move up to half to draw them offsides. But don't go past half as you'll be offsides. Again, communication and practice are vital to be able to play a high line. If you attempt to play a high line and you haven't practiced it, it will probably end in being out of position.\n\n, In addition, it is very common for a slide tackle to get someone a yellow card.\n\n, For example: You are in front of your opponent - he sends the ball left, intercept it by being in your ready-stance, keeping your arms extended to the sides for balance.\n\n, One may go between your legs or over your head, so make sure you are not tensed up. Be loose and alive, to match the opponent's moves in any direction. A way to eliminate the pass when the opponent stops to pass -- between your legs or over your head -- is by keeping your legs staggered (feet not side by side), and in an athletic stance with your knees bent a little, ready to spring.\n\n, Be ready to send the second foot. For example: You are in front of an opponent, and you think he is going to pass left, however when he moved you took your left foot to the left but he passed right; you must be ready to launch toward the right.\n\n,, If someone tries to pass to your opponent, get to the ball first and look for passes that you can intercept.\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock. If the opponent has the ball and is facing the goal, don't give him or her room to shoot. Stay within a couple feet. If he or she shoots, be prepared to dive in and block it, whether it be with foot or your body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your opponent moves, move with him or her. Stay on your toes. If you must give your opponent room, \"herd\" him or her towards the sideline or onto his weaker foot (the one that is already extended).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't let your opponent get past you. Stay on your toes, and be ready to sprint at any time by staying in an athletic stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, So, usually, don't stab or swipe at the ball. You will be off balance, out of position. Your opponent can dribble right past you if you are lurching forward. Just stay close and on guard.\n\n, If you have a teammate behind you (supporting you), you can look to try to take the ball from your opponent. If not, don't try.\n\n,, Make your opponent think only about you, not what else is going on around the field.\n\n, When you are on the sidelines, study his or her 1-on-1 moves and habits.\n\n, If there aren't a lot of defenders in your half of the field, contain your opponent, slowing him or her down and making time for help to arrive. If there are plenty of defenders\/support in your half of the field, you can be a little more assertive.\n\n, Know how they compare to yours, and take risks accordingly.\n\n, Be aware of other players in your field of view. Try to anticipate where your opponent would like to pass, if he can.\n\n, Deception is as powerful as speed. If your opponent thinks you're passive, you can surprise him or her by acting instantly, not showing your trickiness all the time.\n\n, Instead of watching your opponent's feet watch the ball.\n\n, To defend your goal, stay ahead of the opponent.\n\n, If he gets overextended or off balance, then attack.\n\n, Think before fouling them. Understand that if you do take down your opponent, most of the time this will result in a yellow card. With a few tackles (mainly the ones that deny the other player a chance to score), you will be ejected from the game with a red card. Red cards tend to include multiple-game suspensions in many leagues, so before you foul the player from behind, remember what the consequences are! In addition, taking down and potentially injuring a player who has beaten you fairly is not good for your team, as you may be suspended for one or more games.\n\n, To be ready to go where the action will probably need to go. They will be trying to get the ball to a better position to a more open area, away from the sideline, away from the crowded area and such.\n\n",

        "text":"Firstly, most of the African runners you see are from three regions: Nandi, in Kenya, and Arsi and Shewa in Ethiopia, near the Rift Valley. These are high altitude places, which has lead to some thought that there might be a genetic predisposition to being better at endurance sports in these peoples - lower oxygen levels meaning higher red blood cell count and all that.\n\nGenes and diet have both been considered but there isn't a lot of evidence to support it as a theory.\n\nEast African runners tend to use less energy than caucasians, and the explanation generally given is that they carry less weight on their feet and ankles due to body shape.\n\nTraining is also apparently different in East Africa - a sort of quality over quantity approach.  There is also the fact that 50-70% of East African elite athletes ran long distances to get to school every day as children.\n\nThe influence of biology is hotly debated, but it's clear that the stereotype is self-perpetuating and that an endurance running culture (and therefore infrastructure, coaching programmes, etc) might form and lead to future success.",

        "text":"The way to think about any circuit components is in terms of currents and voltages.\n\nOne thing that's important to remember about circuits is that each wire has a constant voltage. Thus, if you have a wire going from the positive terminal of your battery to one plate of your capacitor and another wire going grom the negative terminal of your battery to the other plate of your capacitor, it makes sense to say one capacitor plate is at a positive voltage and one is at a negative voltage.\n\nIn DC circuits (direct current, i.e., AA battery + resistors + capacitors, etc.), capacitors are used as timing components. If you hook a battery up to a resistor, you (essentially) instantly get a current flowing. However, if you hook the battery up to a network of resistors with a few capacitors thrown in there, it will take a little bit of time for the current to reach its \"steady state.\" This is because capacitors cannot change the voltage difference between the two plates (i.e., the voltage ACROSS the capacitor) instantaneously. Therefore you get a time delay in the behavior of your circuit.\n\nWhen you have AC signals (signals that oscillate at a certain frequency), the ones that get through are the ones that oscillate at a much faster rate than the \"time constant\" (or average time delay caused by your capacitor and resistors). What's important is that the voltage on both sides can change quickly, even if the voltage ACROSS the capacitor can change only slowly. Thus, if you look at a quick little portion of an AC signal that makes the voltage on the positive plate jump up really fast, the voltage on the negative plate has to jump up really fast too in order that the voltage stay more\/less the same across the capacitor. In other words, a change in voltage at high frequency (AC) on one side of the capacitor produces an equal change in voltage on the other side, so the signal \"passes through\" the capacitor w\/ AC circuits.",

        "text":"1. Today the majority of adults and teens own or operate a cell phone. The average person is claimed to spend about three hours on a cellular device daily, for others that number is much higher. With cell phones constantly being upgraded and advancing, it makes it more tempting for individuals to buy them and cause people to use them more than what is necessary. This leads to adults and teens to even be tempted to use them even while on the road. Should drivers be able to use a cell phone in any captivity while behind the wheel? Even if it's for something as simple as only using it for GPS directions. It's all up to the way the driver uses that privilege.  The usage of a phone while driving should be avoided as much as possible, especially texting and driving.  When you think about it, texting and driving is the equivalent to driving intoxicated or under the influence.  By taking the chance and texting while driving Your putting you and innocent pedestrians in danger.\n Too many people have lost their lives because someone was not being cautious, being on their device and not paying attention to the road, distracted by their phone trying to reply to a simple message that can wait till you are safely parked or not on the road.  Why risk getting a ticket and having to pay money or even getting arrested or possible taking a life just by being careless and making a little mistake you could have easily refrained from.  Your only increasing the chance of you getting into an accident and endangering someone's life, and if a wreck does happen is likely insurance would cost more because of the situation. You being in the wrong and caused the wreck, meaning you would have to pay more for the insurance  Texting and driving is not only very dangerous it has been made illegal but yet there are still individuals who feel they just need to use their phone while behind the wheel. In conclusion, the overall usage of a cell phone.....that's why teenagers shouldn't drive with the cell phone an be on the phone because u can be focused on the phone with messages and calling an get in a crash an that's good if You got a GPS but phone are not good while driving in the dark it can costed Accident especially when you can't see an got the light in yo face an it's always good to have another person in the car with a phone an your driving.

        "text":"Thomas Green (1679\/1680[?]-1705) was an English sailor and alleged pirate, who was captain of the Worcester. He was hanged on Leith sands in Scotland along with two of his crew on 11 April 1705.\n\nGreen was celebrated in a contemporary ballad:\n\nThe Worcester was seized, probably at the bequest of the Secretary of the Company of Scotland (Roderick Mackenzie), when she came into the Firth of Forth simply to weather a storm; Green and his crew were alleged to have boarded a ship, the ironically named Speedy Return, off the Malabar coast in India, killed the crew and its captain Robert Drummond, stolen the goods on board, then sold the ship.\n\nHowever, the evidence against Green has been considered flimsy; during the trial, the ship in question was never named, and neither the ship's owner nor any next of kin of the alleged deceased came forward. Furthermore, the exact time and place of the incident were never specified (\"upon one or other Days of the Months of February, March, April or May, in the year 1703\").\n\nAs the alleged incident was outside Scottish waters, the veracity of the trial was also called into question; however the prosecution argued that the subjects of the piracy had, according to different witnesses, either sailed under an English flag or had spoken English, and as such, Green and his crew were subject to the justice of Admiralty. To further dispel any pretence of a fair trial, many of the crew were forbidden to provide evidence, and one of those who was allowed - the captain's Indian servant - had been \"chained and nailed to the Floor of the Fore-Castle\" at the time of the alleged incident;\" despite this, his evidence was accepted. The English historian G. M. Trevelyan complained that while \"the 'evidence' did not even pretend to be more than hearsay [...] the court [was] drunk with patriotic prejudice.\"\n\nGreen was sentenced to death, originally intended for the 3 April 1705, but this was postponed for a time at the request of the Queen's Privy Council. During this time it became known to those involved in the trial that survivors of the Speedy Return had arrived back in England, and were ready to testify that it had instead been captured by pirate John Bowen, confirming the innocence of Green and his colleagues. Nevertheless, the Crown's Scottish representatives failed to stand up to an angry Edinburgh mob, and did not postpone the execution date further.\n\nGreen and two of his crew members, an Englishman, Simpson, and John Madder, a Scot, were found guilty and hanged on Leith Sands on 11 April. The men met their deaths, amongst the baying mob, with calm and resolve. It is probable that the Worcester was seized in an act of revenge against the East India Company (for whom Green had earlier worked) that had seized one of the last ships of the Company of Scotland, the Annandale, the previous year. After the executions of the three, the remaining crewmen were quietly released with no further charge. The incident caused great consternation and anger throughout much of England and provided fodder for the vitriolic patriots on both sides of the border.\n\nTrevelyan concluded that the deaths of the three men served as an outlet for a widely held Scottish resentment of their Anglo-centric government's mismanagement. Examples of the problems partially caused by this mis-governance included the Glencoe Massacre, the ill-fated Darien Scheme (the failure of which was partially attributable to King William's concession to English mercantile interest) and the \"seven ill years\" (seven bad harvests experienced by Scottish farmers between 1692 and 1698, blame for which must also lie partially with archaic tools, expertise and practices in use at that time).\n\nScottish historians such as Andrew Lang instead contend that while Green and crew may not have taken Drummond's ship, they had engaged in some piracy after all, and so the trial was not unjust: \"Hence I conclude that the 'Worcester' really had been pirating off the coast of Malabar, but that the ship taken by Captain Green in these waters was not the 'Speedy Return,' but another, unknown. If so, there was no great miscarriage of justice, for the indictment against Captain Green did not accuse him of seizing the 'Speedy Return,' but of piracy, robbery, and murder, though the affair of the 'Speedy Return' was brought in to give local colour. This fact and the national excitement in Scotland probably turned the scale with the jury, who otherwise would have returned a verdict of 'Not Proven.'\"\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \"Historical Mysteries\" by Andrew Lang (page 193–213) - contains an analysis of the Green case with footnotes and some additional correspondence.\n\n1705 deaths\nEnglish pirates\nExecuted English people\nPeople executed by Stuart Scotland\nPeople executed for piracy\nYear of birth uncertain\nPeople executed by the Kingdom of Scotland by hanging",

        "text":"\"I Can Dream About You\" is a song performed by American singer Dan Hartman on the soundtrack album of the film Streets of Fire. Released in 1984 as a single from the soundtrack, and included on Hartman's album I Can Dream About You, it reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBackground\nThe song first appeared in Streets of Fire, where it was performed by the fictional group The Sorels. The real voice behind the version used in the film was Winston Ford, but Hartman's version was the one used on the soundtrack album and released as a single. In a Songfacts interview with the film's musical director, Kenny Vance, he recalled the following:\"The same guy that sings lead on that and \"Countdown to Love,\" a song that I wrote for the film, was a guy working at a Radio Shack (Winston Ford), and I think when you look at the film and The Sorels are singing it live in the movie, that was the version that was supposed to come out, and I recorded that version. But then when Dan Hartman heard it, I don't know what happened next, but I know that he took that guy's voice off and he put his own on, and he had a hit with it. Hollywood is a very slippery place.\"\n\nOriginally, producer Jimmy Iovine had asked Hartman to write a song for a film he was working on. Hartman was told that the song was going to be sung by four Black guys in a concert situation within the film, and Hartman ended up thinking about a demo he made of \"I Can Dream About You.\" As described by Tuber (1985), Hartman went through some “legal maneuvering to get the benefit of his breakthrough”. The use of the song in the film being performed by actors did not feature Hartman on vocals but rather Ford. After some negotiating to enforce the original contract, Hartman insisted he sing the song on the soundtrack, and that his version be released if a single were to be issued from the soundtrack album. Additionally, any music video had to feature his own voice using the song. These clauses helped Hartman become an \"overnight sensation\" despite the fact that Hartman had been a working musician since adolescence. In an interview snippet from Portzline (2014), Hartman elaborated on another controversy related to the song—stating that “…some people had a fit because it was my name and my voice coming out of this group that looked like the Temptations. It was a big mess, but it was the best I could do under the circumstance.\"\n\nIn the film, the Sorels are played by Stoney Jackson (lead singer), Grand L. Bush, Mykelti Williamson and Robert Townsend (the latter three portraying backing singers). In a 2012 interview, Williamson stated that people were initially confused and thought that Jackson was Hartman. As a result, Hartman was supposedly upset; however, he might have had a change of heart by the following year due to the “good publicity” that the confusion generated (Tuber, 1985). Although the choreography for the Sorels was arranged by Jeffrey Hornaday, the actors eventually improvised much of the dance moves with Hornaday’s support. Williamson further mentioned that he, Jackson, Bush and Townsend received vocal coaching from Jim Gilstrap and they provided background vocals for the track. In the vinyl releases, Hartman, Joe Pizzulo, and Ford are credited as providing backing vocals for the song. Thus, in the interview, Williamson may have been referring to the version that appeared in the film with Ford's vocals. Frank and George Simms, who perform as The Simms Brothers Band and worked as backup singers for artists such as David Bowie, revealed in a 2021 podcast that they sang on \"I Can Dream About You\" as a favor to Hartman but were uncredited due to the song's quick release thereafter. \n\nAccording to Daryl Hall, Hartman had initially written the song with Hall & Oates in mind, and offered the song to them to record as their own. Hall & Oates declined, as their new album was about to be released. Later in their career, however, they issued an album of covers called Our Kind of Soul, in 2004, on which they recorded their own version (with changed lyrics) of Hartman's song. When performing the song live in February 2005, Hall revealed before the performance:\"Here's a song that we did on the new album that we sort of did twenty years late. An old friend of ours, Dan Hartman, wrote this song. I remember back in the day he came up to me and said 'You know, I have this great song I wrote for you guys. It's you, you know? – you have to sing this song.' And unfortunately we had just finished an album, we couldn't put it on the album so I said sorry Dan. About six months later I was watching MTV and there it was, and it was a hit for him, God bless him. So here we are twenty years later, I hope he's hearing it, and I hope he enjoys it.\"Before Ford settled as a musician in Colorado, he went on to tour as a vocalist for artists such as The Platters, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Drifters and Phat Daddy. He died in a motor vehicle accident in 2007 in Denver.\n\nAlbum release and promotion\nBoth Hartman and Iovine worked on his 1984, same-titled solo album I Can Dream About You, following the song's use in the film. The album would spawn two other Top 40 charting singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 – \"We Are the Young\" and \"Second Nature\". A tour was also organized to promote the I Can Dream About You album and its singles, and Hartman toured alongside Toto in 1985. It was his first tour in a decade but also his last. The song was performed on this tour.\n\nMusic videos and promotion\nTwo music videos accompanied the song. One does not feature Hartman and consists of scenes from Streets of Fire, intercut with footage of the fictional Sorels miming the song as part of a live performance.  In the second video, filmed at the Hard Rock in London, Hartman appears as a bartender trying to charm a young woman (played by Joyce Hyser), singing to her as the Sorels' performance plays on a TV set hanging above the bar. In a 2010 interview with Hyser for the blog Old School: Back to the 80s, she was asked how she came to feature in the video. She replied, \"I knew Dan's manager and he asked me if I would do it. We shot at the Hard Rock in London. I honestly remember very little about it, but Dan was very nice and I absolutely love that song.\" While recording a mimed TV performance of the song, Hartman explained why one music video featured actors: \"The producers and directors of Streets of Fire wanted the best of everything, so they hired the best singers, the best dancers and best actors to play the parts in the film. So the singers in \"I Can Dream About You\" who are the Sorels are actually actors, and I wrote and sang this song.\"\n\nAside from the two music videos which accompanied the song, Hartman appeared on various American and European TV shows to perform the song once it was released as a single. On the musical variety show Soul Train, during December 1984, Hartman dubbed the song with his touring band, along with \"We are the Young\", and later appeared on the show solo in May 1985 to perform both \"I Can Dream About You\" and \"Second Nature\" alone, but with live vocal. He also dubbed the song on the music-performance program American Bandstand in December 1984, with his touring band. \"Second Nature\" was also performed, and both performances aired on the January 12, 1985, episode of the show. In November 1984, Hartman and his band performed the song on Late Night with David Letterman, along with \"We Are the Young\". It was also dubbed on the American syndicated half hour television show This Week's Music, where his name was incorrectly spelled as 'Harkman'.\n\nWithin the UK, Hartman performed the song on Top of the Pops, dated August 29, 1985.

        "text":" Most high schools have an orientation period where you can visit the school. While you're at orientation, try talking to other people to see if you have any common interests.For example, you could say, \"Hi! I'm John. So are you starting here, too? I'm going to be in the band. What about you?\";\n, Most high schools have a wide variety of clubs and activities for you to join, based on your interest. The best thing about joining clubs is you'll meet other teens with the same interest, which gives you something to talk about.For instance, maybe you want to join the speech club or the art club, or maybe you want to be a part of the marching band or the choir. You'll find other teens who love art or music, just like you.If you don't see a club you like, ask your administrators about starting a club around that interest. Just make sure it's school-appropriate before asking. You'll probably need a teacher to sponsor you, as well.\n\n, That is, the more often you see the same group of people, the more familiar you become to those people. Over time, you'll start to become closer and closer to people in that group. Try to sit with the same group of people at lunch, for instance. Alternatively, the group can be people you sit with in class or people you see in one of your clubs or activities., Some teens probably came up to high school from middle school with you. Try to meet up with old friends, even ones you weren't that close to. You may find you have more in common now that you are in high school.When you see an old friend in the hallway, be sure to say hello. Ask about a time to hang out, or see if you can do homework together to catch up on old times.\n\n, People can't get to know you if you never say anything. Don't be afraid to introduce yourself or speak up in class or meetings.Start by saying hello to the people near you in class before the bell rings. You could say, \"Hi, I'm Jess. I'm excited about it being the first day of school, but I'm a little nervous, too. What about you?\"\n\n, When you find people you like, ask if you can join them. For instance, say you see someone at lunch that you have a class with. Ask if you can sit with them.For instance, you could say, \"Hey, we have math together, right? Do you mind if I sit here?\"\n\n, People like hearing nice things about themselves. When you give someone a compliment, it opens the door for conversation. It makes them feel good, and it will make you feel good, too.The best compliments are specific. For example, rather than saying, \"I think you're smart,\" you could say, \"It's amazing how quickly you pick up what Mr. Roberts is saying in math. It's like you're a math wizard!\"\n\n, One way to start turning people into friends is to learn about the person. That is, get him or her to talk about themselves. People like to talk about themselves, so asking them questions can get them talking. For instance, ask about their favorite school subjects or what they like to do outside of school.As an example, you could ask, \"So what do you like to do for fun?\" or \"Do you have a favorite video game?\"\n\n, One tried-and-true way to make friends is to be nice to people. You like it when people are nice to you, right? Well, so does everyone else. Try bringing a treat to share with a new friend or helping someone pick up their books in the hallway when they drop them. These little acts of kindness go a long way to helping you to make friends and belong., Just like you want to fit in, so do other people. It can be tempting to exclude people who aren't like you, but then you're doing the thing you're trying to avoid from other people. In other words, you're making the problem worse. No one's perfect. You have to accept people as they are.That doesn't mean you need to be friends with people who are mean to you or who bully you. Rather, it means that you shouldn't try to exclude someone from being your friend just because you think he or she is a little weird.\n\n, \"Fit in\" implies that you want to be like everyone else to make friends. In high school (and adult life), that can be very tempting. It feels easier to hide parts of yourself than to be true to yourself and risk the chance of being pushed out of a group. However, living in a way that's not true to yourself will make you feel worse over time. In addition, letting your personality shine will help you find other people who are like you, creating a group of solid friends.\"Fitting in\" often means you have to change yourself to basically go unnoticed in a group. \"Belonging\" implies the group actively wants you to be there., That is, every person is unique with a unique set of thoughts, ideas, and feelings. Yes, you are different from everyone else, but ever other person is, too. What does that mean for fitting in? It may mean embracing those differences and finding other people who are willing to embrace those differences, too., Sometimes, it may take you a little while to find your group of people. You may feel lonely for a bit. If you keep working at, though, hopefully you will find a group of people who cares about who you are as a person.Meanwhile, keep doing what you love and joining groups that interest you. Keep saying hello to people in your classes.\n\n, Maybe you've formed a group of friends in your band because you have a shared interest. That's typical of a group of friends. Other times, groups of friends may form because of shared values, such as you all believe in the same religion, and you are welcoming to others who want to join in. Cliques, on the other hand, push for conformity, and they are often focused on being the most popular or the most in. The problem with cliques is they intentionally exclude others making people feel left out.Another defining aspect of cliques is that it's the only group members can belong to. In other words, if you were in a clique, you probably wouldn't be able to have friends in band or art class, for example. That hurts you, since you may be excluding yourself from some great people who could be awesome friends.",

Until you feel that you agree with any opinion. and knowing that it could help you prevent anything that could happen in the future when you need it.  it could help you get rid of the negative thoughts and thinking less when you know you have multiple advice and opinions  second, the more people you have by your side are the best choices you make. because they support you and will give you great advice. And also giving small talks (advice). because they know how you feel and know what you like to hear from others. finally, it could help to improve ideas and thoughts you might ve had in your head. because you think how you plan out your ideas without making a mistake.  you have a chance to make better choices when you get advice from others  And it could also help not to make mistakes.

But it does. having a good variety of choices is better than having none. Because the good choices could take you to a better future, better education and good career. but having none could take no where.

        "text":"Penza () is the largest city and administrative center of Penza Oblast, Russia. It is located on the Sura River,  southeast of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, Penza had a population of 517,311, making it the 36th-largest city in Russia.\n\nEtymology \nThe city name is a hydronym and means in  () from pen 'end of (genitive)' and sa(ra) 'swampy river'.\n\nGeography\n\nUrban layout\n\nThis central quarter occupies the territory on which the wooden fortress Penza was once located, therefore it is sometimes called the Serf. The architectural concept of the old fortress, erected on the eastern slope of the mountain above the river, predetermined the direction of the first streets. The direction and location of the first streets were set by the passage towers of the fortress and the orientation of its walls. This is how the first six streets of the city were formed. Subsequently, the names were fixed to them: Governor's, Lekarskaya, Moscow, Nikolskaya, Sadovaya and Teatralnaya.\n\nAn important element of the urban development of the city is that the square of the fortress created a network of streets converging at right angles. Initially, there was no proper harmony in them. Often the difficult terrain of the area forced the direction and width of the road to change. Here and there, spontaneous development took shape. Nevertheless, the urban planning matrix was created and predetermined the development of the city for several centuries. During the reign of Empress Catherine the Great, the first general plan of Penza was drawn up, it was approved on October 6, 1785. The city was rebuilt anew in accordance with the rectilinear structure of St. Petersburg. The plan of the city, in its central part practically did not change, as it fully complied with the new norms of Russian urban planning. The mutually perpendicular orientation of the streets and the accompanying division of the urban environment into standard quarters was the original and distinctive feature of Penza. Perhaps Penza owes this to its first builders, who are well acquainted with the European urban planning trends of the 17th century - the German Joseph von Sommer (Lieutenant Colonel of the Moscow Service Osip Zumerovsky) and the Polish nobleman Yuri Kotransky. At the end of the next 18th century, in the process of implementing Catherine's master plan for Penza, only some sections of the old streets were straightened, the standard width of the roadway and sidewalks was set. The redevelopment of the city was preceded by the resettlement of the serving suburban population from the center to suburban villages and wastelands. Newly carved quarters of the Upland part of the city, more comfortable for living, were inhabited by the nobility and eminent merchants.\nInitially, the fortress was not only a defense complex, but also the administrative center of a vast region. On that place the governor, archives, treasury, prison, arsenal and other instruments of the regional statehood were settled. In the fortress there was the main cathedral of the region – Spassky and the main square of the city – Cathedral. In accordance with the General Plan of 1785, the dilapidated fortress, trading rows and philistine buildings adjacent to its walls were dismantled. As a result of clearing, the posadskaya Nikolskaya church came out of the environment of spontaneous buildings and acquired a harmonious look, becoming a true decoration of the city.\n\nFor several years, on the territory of the central quarter and adjacent streets, state-owned stone buildings were complexly erected: the bishop's courtyard, the governor's residence, the assembly of the nobility and two buildings of public places (7.1 and 7.4).) By the beginning of the 20th century, private residential There are no buildings left in the Fortress Quarter of the city. In the Fortress Quarter there is also a special administrative street of the city – the Line of Public Places, passing from Sadovaya to Moskovskaya, bypassing the Spassky Cathedral. It has never had and still does not have residential buildings. the eastern earthen rampart of the old Penza fortress The ancient defensive rampart runs along the western side of Kirov Street (on this section, Kirov Street was formerly called Teatralnaya Street).\n\nThe Cathedral was destroyed by the Communists in 1934, and rebuilt between 2010 and 2022.\n\nHistory\n\nPenza was founded as a Russian frontier fortress-city, and to this day, remnants of the Lomovskaya sentry line built in 1640 have been preserved at the western edge of the city, and remains of earth ramparts dating from the mid-16th century are preserved in the city center. Until 1663, Penza was a wooden stockade with only a small settlement. In May 1663, the architect Yuri Kontransky arrived in Penza on the Tsar's orders to direct the construction of a fortress city, as part of a wider fortress building program to protect Russia from attacks by Crimean Tatars.   The initial construction consisted of a wooden Kremlin, a village, and quarters for the nobility, small tradesmen, and merchants. The Muscovite government placed the Cossacks here, who constructed a fortress and called it \"Cherkassy Ostroh\", from which the regional city of Penza has developed, thanks to the arrival of new settlers, particularly Russians. The Cossack roots of the city and its first settlers are now remembered in the names of Cherkasskaya street, along with the \"Cherkassy\" historical district.\n\nIn 1774, the insurgent army led by Yemelyan Pugachev occupied Penza after the citizens of the city welcomed the rebellious Cossacks. The first stone houses started to appear after 1801, and by 1809 Penza's population had grown to more than 13,000 people.\n\nIn 1918, Vladimir Lenin sent a telegram to communists in the Penza area, complaining about the \"insurrection of five kulak districts\". He urged the public hanging of 100 \"landlords, richmen, bloodsuckers\", grain seizure, and hostage-liberation. This telegram has been used in several historical works on the period and on Lenin. During the Russian Civil War, the Czechoslovak Legions launched an anti-Bolshevik uprising in Penza.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the city developed as a regional industrial center. The Ural mainframe was made here between 1959 and 1964.\n\nAdministrative and municipal status\nPenza is the administrative center of the oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Penza—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Penza is incorporated as Penza Urban Okrug.\n\nTransportation\nPenza is a major railway junction and lies on the M5 highway linking Moscow and Chelyabinsk. Penza Airport serves domestic flights. Local public transport includes buses, trolleybuses and marshrutkas (routed taxis).\n\nEducation and culture\n\nCurrently, the city of Penza is seen as a regional center for higher education. It has six universities (the Penza State University, the Pedagogic University, the Academy of Agriculture, the Technology Institute, the University of Architecture and Construction, and the Artillery and Engineering Institute), 13 colleges and 77 public schools. Penza's largest repertoire theatre  is Penza Oblast Drama Theater named after A. V. Lunacharsky.  Another prominent and unique theater is the Theater of Doctor Dapertutto, founded by Natalia Kugel and located in the former home of Russian theater director Vsevolod Meyerhold. Besides this, Penza is home to four museums, and three art galleries including The Museum of One Painting named after G. V. Myasnikov.\n\nFacilities of higher education include:\nPenza State University\nPenza State Pedagogical University (unified with Penza State University in 2012)\nPenza State University of Architecture and Construction\nPenza Artillery Engineering Institute\nPenza State Technological Academy\nPenza State Agricultural University\nPenza branch of the Moscow's Institute of Economics, Management and Law\nPenza branch of the Russian State University of Innovative Technologies and Entrepreneurship\n\nClimate\nPenza has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with long, cold winters and warm summers. Due to the vast landmass, the summer is much warmer than its 53°N latitude would suggest. The same factors also result in very cold winters by upper mid-latitude European standards. A heat wave in the months of June, July, and August 2010, raised temperatures from previous norms often by  in Penza. Some of the higher fluctuations in temperatures were recorded with seven straight days of temperatures  and higher compared to the previous year where the higher temperatures for the same period were, on average,  lower.\n\nSports\nPenza first hosted the Russian Sidecarcross Grand Prix in 2009, and did so again in 2010, on August 15.\n\nDizel Penza is Penza's professional hockey team, playing in the VHL.  Dizelist Penza is a junior club playing in the NMHL.\n\nThe city football team FC Zenit Penza was established in 1918 but now plays in the Russian Amateur League.

        "text":"Hi,\n\nThis is by no means an area I am an expert in. However, that being said, I will attempt to answer in general about European immigration to the United States in the 19th century because I've been teaching subjects like this for nearly a decade. This answer is general and wide-ranging and not an in-depth look at Norwegians as immigrants, per se. Think of it as a Freshman-level survey lecture. One final disclaimer that, I think, fits with any question about historical motivations and actions; \"It's complicated.\"\n\nWith those out of the way, let's delve a little into the phenomena of American migration and the immigrant story as a whole:\n\n* Immigration to the United States was the product of \"boosterism\"\n\nBasically, both officials from the US government and citizens alike 'sold' life in the United States as a golden opportunity. Mind you, this was not unique to the United States itself; the [British government used to advertise owning farms and land and opportunity in Canada] (_URL_7_) to the swelling populations of the 19th century. In fact, some have argued that ['transportation'] (_URL_8_) to Australia was also a release valve for excess population. Essentially, there was a wide-ranging 'sales' pitch to draw Europeans (and Asians) to \"The West\" (a vague, wide term that includes many places we would not think of as 'western' today.) \n\nA good example of this sales pitch, though coming at the tail end of the 19th century, is the adventuresome [\"dime novels\"] (_URL_4_) which, tall tales aside, painted the West as an empty land ready for exploitation. Newspaper reporters and fiction writers alike jumped upon the bandwagon of these tales because appetite for them in Europe pretty much guaranteed newspaper sales (and writers' incomes). Moreover, and perhaps more famously, [\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Shows\"] (_URL_1_) romanticized America to the European market; America was a place where a man could prove his manliness through near-mythical deeds! He was immensely popular and his act performed for Queen Victoria and the Pope by the end of the 19th century. \n\nCan't imagine getting swept up in the fever of a new land? Well, imagine if a newssite broke the story of a previously-unknown continent that was 'empty' and ready for settling. A place where you could start a new life with a new name and a new identity. How many 21st century Americans themselves would leap at the chance to abandon debt, shitty credit scores, acrimonious politics, social inequality, economic disparity, and the banal evils of corporate life for an opportunity for adventure and excitement?\n\nAdd to this stories of immigrants who 'made it' in the USA - people like [Levi Strauss] (_URL_5_), [Andrew Carnegie] (_URL_0_), and [Adolphus Busch] (_URL_3_) - and you have a powerful incentive to risk literally everything in a voyage to the USA and traversing unknown regions of a dangerous continent.\n\n* Free land\/cheap land is better than expensive land\/hereditary land.\n\nUnlike Europe, the Canadian\/American West had lots of 'unused' land, according to boosters (please know it certianly wasn't \"empty\" nor \"unused\" but that's a different conversation). This goes hand-in-hand with the above point; it was a tradition in North America to offer cheap or free land to entice Europeans over to the New World, but these (such as the Headright acts in 1600s Virginia) were met with mixed results. The difference between 1600 and 1800 boils down to changes in agriculture and medicine in Europe which led to higher populations and over-crowding of the land and cities. This, in turn, led to high land and property prices (as well as taxes) for new families, meaning many people's dreams of having their own farm\/land\/business would always be a 'dream.'\n\nComparatively, the US government offered free land periodically through things like the Homestead Act of 1862 which opened up millions of acres of land for a pittance in order to get European (read \"White Europeans\" from North and West Europe) and American presences in the region; this would lead to settled farmers producing food and forcing out the Native Americans whose land it really was (though the US gov't conveniently neglected to tell Europeans as such). About 1.5 million homesteaders, not all of whom were US citizens by birth, took up the offer of free or nearly-free land during the lifetime of the Act and its 'spin offs' (smaller, more regional acts that hoped to have the same draw) continued well into the 20th century, drawing people to places like Nebraska. Best of all, taxes - if they existed at all in the region - were miniscule compared to Europe. Free land and no taxes? Sign me up, right?\n\nSo, Europeans had a choice; stay and maybe scrape enough together to maybe afford some land or sell pretty much everything and take a gamble on snagging some 'free' land.\n\n* Europeans were politically convulsed\n\nWhile not quite as applicable to Scandinavians, most of Europe at the time was going through some pretty scary political, social, and economic upheavals that made staying in Europe in the mid-19th century particularly dicey. German, Italian, Irish, Polish, and many other Europeans were faced with [political revolution, unemployment, and literal starvation] (_URL_6_) in the mid-19th century. The option then was to stay and maybe die or to take a gamble and maybe live. A good example is the Potato Blight which most famously affected the Irish (leading to over half the population dying or fleeing to foreign shores), but Germany and Belgium were also affected deeply, especially the poor and working class whose diet was extremely dependent upon the humble spud. Comparatively, with the exception of 1860 to 1865, the United States seemed relatively stable and prosperous.\n\nStay and die or move and live (probably)? Which would you choose?\n\n* Relatives and community were already here in some cases.\n\nOnly a relative few immigrants 'blazed the trail' so to speak. Many were enticed to come to the USA by relatives and friends who had gone before. Immigrant communities - speaking their mother tongue primarily (or exclusively) - were common in the \"West.\" Many frontier cities had newspapers and laws passed in the mother tongue, despite being in the USA. Why? Comfort and familiarity. Immigrants banded together in order to look out for each other and provide a sense of continuity and 'normalcy' to their new lives. Larger communities drew more people and made possible more success stories. Usually, more immigrants settled relatively stable areas and only the truly desperate or foolhardy settled 'frontiers.'\n\nI like your term \"unbuilt\"; the immigrant experience allows the newcomer to craft a world closer to their liking. It gave immigrants agency in crafting their future; a world that had all the good stuff of the homeland and all the stuff they liked about the new place. This is something they could never really have done even in the most liberal of European countries. Interestingly, the act of \"building\" reinforced cooperation and community while, ironically, perpetuating the myth of rugged individualism and made the transition from settled Europe to 'unbuilt' USA more palatable and less scary.\n\nIn conclusion, there are a LOT of reasons why a Norwegian would come out to the badlands of the West and persevere in the face of such hardships. But a combination of sales pitch, free land, a desire to remake the world as you see fit, and the lure of 'making it' all combine into a rather powerful impulse to \"go to such a far distance.\"\n\nSources:\n\n*Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People* by Alan Brinkley 2014\n\n*Immigrant America: A Portrait* by Alejandro Portes et. al 2006\n\n*Norwegians and Swedes In America: Friends and Neighbors* Ed by Philip Anderson et. al. 2012\n\n*Immigrants in the American Civil War* History channel, American History in Film database, 2008\n\n[The Buffalo Bill Center of the West] (_URL_9_)\n\n[Library of Congress: The Homestead Act] (_URL_2_)\n\nEDIT: Spelling mistakes here and there (how did you guys let me get away with that?)",

        "text":"The paper proposes a recurrent neural architecture that can skip irrelevant\ninput units. This is achieved by specifying R (# of words to read at each\n\"skim\"), K (max jump size), and N (max # of jumps allowed). An LSTM processes R\nwords, predicts the jump size k in {0, 1...K} (0 signals stop), skips the next\nk-1 words and continues until either the number of jumps reaches N or the model\nreaches the last word. While the model is not differentiable, it can be trained\nby standard policy gradient. The work seems to have been heavily influenced by\nShen et al. (2016) who apply a similar reinforcement learning approach\n(including the same variance stabilization) to multi-pass machine reading. \n\n- Strengths:\n\nThe work simulates an intuitive \"skimming\" behavior of a reader, mirroring Shen\net al. who simulate (self-terminated) repeated reading. A major attribute of\nthis work is its simplicity. Despite the simplicity, the approach yields\nfavorable results. In particular, the authors show through a well-designed\nsynthetic experiment that the model is indeed able to learn to skip when given\noracle jump signals. In text classification using real-world datasets, the\nmodel is able to perform competitively with the non-skimming model while being\nclearly faster. \n\nThe proposed model can potentially have meaningful practical implications: for\ntasks in which skimming suffices (e.g., sentiment classification), it suggests\nthat we can obtain equivalent results without consuming all data in a\ncompletely automated fashion. To my knowledge this is a novel finding. \n\n- Weaknesses:\n\nIt's a bit mysterious on what basis the model determines its jumping behavior\nso effectively (other than the synthetic dataset). I'm thinking of a case where\nthe last part of the given sentence is a crucial evidence, for instance: \n\n\"The movie was so so and boring to the last minute but then its ending blew me\naway.\" \n\nIn this example, the model may decide to skip the rest of the sentence after\nreading \"so so and boring\". But by doing so it'll miss the turning point\n\"ending blew me away\" and mislabel the instance as negative. For such cases a\nsolution can be running the skimming model in both directions as the authors\nsuggest as future work. But in general the model may require more sophisticated\narchitecture for controlling skimming.\n\nIt seems one can achieve improved skimming by combining it with multi-pass\nreading (presumably in reverse directions). That's how humans read to\nunderstand text that can't be digested in one skim; indeed, that's how I read\nthis draft. \n\nOverall, the work raises an interesting problem and provides an effective but\nintuitive solution.",

        "text":"Vinko Puljić (; born 8 September 1945) is a Bosnian prelate of the Catholic Church who has been a cardinal since 1994. He was the archbishop of Vrhbosna from 1991 to 2022.\n\nEarly life and education\nThe twelfth of thirteen children, Vinko Puljić was born in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina (then part of Yugoslavia), to Ivan and Kaja Puljić. His mother died when he was three-years-old, and his father then remarried. In addition to his family, young Vinko's spiritual formation was deeply influenced by the Trappist Mariastern Abbey, located not far from his native village. One of the monks helped Vinko's father to send his son to the minor seminary of Zagreb. Father Ante Artner sold his motorbike and gave the proceeds to Vinko's father, who did not have enough money to pay his board there. Vinko then studied philosophy and theology at the major seminary of Đakovo.\n\nPriesthood\nPuljić was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Stjepan Bauerlein on 29 June 1970, and then served as a chaplain in the Diocese of Banja Luka until 1973, whence he became an official of the diocesan curia. He was a parish priest in Sasina from June to November 1973, and in Ravska from 1973 to 1978. In 1978, he was named spiritual director of the minor seminary of Zadar. During this time, he also served as a confessor at a Benedictine monastery and organized spiritual retreats for priests, seminarians, and nuns.\n\nIn 1987, he returned to the Diocese of Banja Luka, where he served as a parish priest in Bosanska Gradiška. He was later transferred to Sarajevo in 1990 as vice-rector of the Sarajevo major seminary.\n\nEpiscopal ministry\n\nOn 19 November 1990 Puljić was appointed Archbishop of Vrhbosna by Pope John Paul II. He thus became the sixth archbishop of that see after the reconstruction of the ordinary ecclesiastical hierarchy in 1881 after the Ottoman occupational rule which had lasted more than four centuries. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1991 from John Paul II himself, with archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nPuljić was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Chiara a Vigna Clara by John Paul II in the consistory of 26 November 1994. He was 49 years old when he became the youngest member of the College of Cardinals. On 18 October 2001 he was invested as bailiff of the Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Puljić was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI and in the 2013 papal conclave, which elected Pope Francis.\n\n He served as president of the Bishops' Conference of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1995 to 2002, and again from 2005 to 2010. On 18 September 2012 Pope Benedict XVI named him as a Synod Father of the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops which was held in October 2012.\n\nViews\n\nRole during the Bosnian War\n\nWhen the Bosnian War broke out in 1992, Archbishop Puljić immediately became involved in helping the thousands of refugees and exiles, mobilizing all the forces of the local Church.\nDuring the war, he frequently risked his life while making pastoral trips to his parishes, so he was imprisoned during one visit for twelve hours by the Serbian military in Ilijaš, running a serious risk when he rode in a United Nations Protection Force tank to Vareš. John Paul II once said to him, \"When I imposed hands on you...to consecrate you in the office of Pastor of the Church of Sarajevo, I had no idea that very shortly your cross would be so heavy and your cup so bitter.\"\n\nStatus of Međugorje\nCardinal Puljić, speaking at the 2004 assembly of the Synod of Bishops, said that the unity of the Church is threatened by the disobedience of the Franciscan monks serving at Međugorje, who \"impose their own points of view\". In 2006, the Episcopal Conference of Bosnia and Herzegovina considered setting up a commission to examine the alleged Marian apparitions. He later served on the commission chaired by Cardinal Ruini.\n\nRelations with Muslims\nCardinal Puljić has said that before the war, relations with Muslims were very good, but that in recent times, the situation has somewhat deteriorated. The first sign was the arrival of humanitarian aid from Arab countries. It was distributed only to Muslims, while at the same time it was prohibited to give it to Christians. In 2012, Cardinal Puljić warned about the spreading of Wahhabism in Southeastern Europe, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, stating that the state authorities are not capable of preventing it. At the same time he warned about the discrimination of Catholics in the Bosnian society, demanding equal treatment for Catholics in employment, education, and other areas. He confirmed that he will continue to try to establish a dialogue and peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was disrupted by the recent war in the country.\n\nWomen and marriage\nIn May 2016, Puljić drew controversy  after appealing to women in a sermon in Zadar, Croatia not to have sexual intercourse before marriage so that they wouldn't become a \"štraca\", which is a local slang word for a \"whore\". The word became a meme, as well, spawning the creation of various Facebook groups numbering thousands of people. The cardinal claimed in response that his words were \"taken out of context\" despite different implications based on the transcript of the sermon, but concedes that the word he used is too harsh.\n\nClergy sex abuse\nIn February 2019, Puljić said in an interview that there were several cases of clergy abuse in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well, but that he did not report them to the police. Puljić did not publish the names of the abusers or the place where they were at the service.\n\nPersonal life\nOn 2 December 2020, it was confirmed that Puljić tested positive for COVID-19, amid its pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina; by 12 December, he recovered.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBiography @ catholic-pages.com\nMeeting with Cardinal Puljic, Bosnia and Herzegovina U.S. Institute of Peace Event, May 2006 (Audio available)\n\n1945 births\nLiving people\nCroat Roman Catholic clergy from Bosnia and Herzegovina\nBishops of Banja Luka\nBosnia and Herzegovina cardinals\nArchbishops of Vrhbosna\nBishops appointed by Pope John Paul II\n21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nCardinals created by Pope John Paul II\nP",

        "text":"I hope this isn't too long-winded, but I guess you're going to have to read everything in order to understand the complexity of Chinese politics. I will use a lot of metaphors and similes to systems that you may be familiar with. I studied Chinese politics at a Western university as well as a top university in China.\n\n* **Who is in charge?**\n* **How is power distributed at the center?**\n\nThe government is split between ***party*** organs and ***state*** organs. The party organ has the **Politburo Standing Committee**. As a metaphor, think of this as the 9 most powerful people in the Democratic or Republican parties that make all the policy decisions, except it's always one party, the **Chinese Communist Party**. Hu Jintao is the boss here. The party organ also has the **National Party Congress** that meets every year (made up of 2000 party members). Think of this as the Republican National Convention or Democratic National Convention. They don't make policy or have power like the Politburo Standing Committee, but they get together to talk. This is where major announcements are delivered, like e.g. the new massive rail expansion project.\n\nYou also have the government organs. These exist for the party to *govern through*. The main part is the **Standing Committee of the State Council**. This is like a cabinet of ministers (or like secretaries like in the US). Wen Jiabao, the Premier, is the boss here. Also as a part of the state, you have the **National People's Congress**. This is a huge body of 3000 politicians which are elected by politicians from the provinces. They are sort of like the American House of Representatives. But they have no power. They are like the American House of Representatives, and not the entire Congress because their major role is more like a group of lobbyists for regional interests. \n\nAnd then you have a weird group called the **Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference**, which is how the Chinese Communist Party gives 'voice' to those not in the party. It is largely made up of business leaders today, and acts as the link between government and business in order to make the country's economy grow.\n\nThe relationship between the party and state is a little redundant. The Standing Committee of the State Council is made up entirely of Party members. There is no puppetmaster relationship because the state is made up of the party.\n\nSo what why do we still distinguish between the two? What role does one play that the other doesn't? The Party's role is to translate ideology into policy. The state's role is to implement the policy. The Party acts to promote and reward 'cadre' (party leaders), and the best bureaucrats are selected by the party. They are called **nomenklatura**. The Party can't be bothered to control every aspect of the public sector, so they delegate power to bureaucrats that don't act officially in the name of Party. These bureaucrats make up the **bianzhi**, or 'establishiment', which is similar to their public service. The party leaders (nomenklatura) and the administrative tasks they delegate to public service professionals (bianzhi) is where the party and state interlock.\n\n**TL;DR: Although there are state institutions, the country is largely run by CCP members, and real power is concentrated at the very top.**\n\n* **How centralised\/decentralised is the country?**\n* **How is power distributed at different levels?**\n\nAnother area is the fact that there are different levels of government. You can't understand Chinese government without understanding it's levels of government because if there is any body that \"checks\" the central government, it may be the provinces.\n\nJust like the U.S., China is a big country. The way the government does its job in such a big country is to delegate power to sub-governments. In the U.S., the states have their own power to do many things. This is a \"division of power\". This is what it means to be a federalist country.\n\nChina is big too. But the difference is that the central government doesn't want to give power to the provinces (they have 22 provinces and 4 cities big enough to have province status). They do not 'divide' power between the province and themselves like the U.S., Canada, or India does. They let the provinces do some of the things to take some weight off of themselves, and to allow the provinces to take care of themselves. In the late 80s, the central government allowed the provinces to raise and keep their own tax revenues (they call this **'eating in separate kitchens'**).\n\nSo wouldn't the central government be afraid of loosing power to the provinces now that the provinces have the power to tax and spend on their own? How does the central government *see* what's going on in the provinces to keep an eye on them. They use the ***cadre evaluation system*** to keep an eye on the provinces. This means that the central government can appoint or fire anyone at a lower government. Just like any company, this forces local employees to please and suck up to the central goverment--if they want a raise.\n\nJust like a company, lower level governments report to upper level governments. The city officials do their work and report to their province officials for evaluation. The provinces then do their work and report to the central government for evaluation. This is called the ***tiao* relationship** (vertical hierarchy).\n\nWhat about the Party? How does the Party make sure all these local governments are following their ideology and policies? The city officials have to report to their city party committee. The provincial officials have to report to their provincial party committee. And of course, same at the central level. This is the ***kuai* relationship** (horizontal accountability).\n\nSo there are two bosses to report to! In the case of a city government, what if the Party Committee of that city tells the city to do something different than what their provincial superiors told them? Usually these two argue over power, but in the majority of cases, the Party committee wins out, because the Chinese Communist Party evaluates and elects all government officials.\n\nSo now we know how the central government *sees* the local governments, and how they give orders. They do it this way because they want constant control over the lower levels of government, unlike in the U.S., Canada or India, which simply give their lower governments their own authority.\n\n**TL;DR: China is a big country and its government looks after the country by assigning some powers to different levels of the country. Nonetheless, the central government in Beijing has the ultimate word.**\n\n**EDIT:** This is not to say the provinces and cities are not powerful. The provinces on the coast are rich and play host to China's economic boom. They have considerable lobby power and usually get what they want because the central government wants to act seamlessly to promote their economic success. Shanghai is big enough to have province-status, and that former city's leader now runs the administration of the Party and is most likely going to be the next leader of China (to replace Hu Jintao).\n\n* **How democratic or otherwise is the country?**\n\nChina is **very** undemocratic. Although a large 6-8% of the citizens are members of the party, this does not satisfy the democratic requirement of *effective* citizen participation as important decision making is exclusively made at the top levels. In 1979, a law was passed allowing for direct election of delegates to township and county-level congresses \"under controlled circumstances\". **This process is not entirely democratic** as not just anyone could run. You have to be nominated and endorsed by the CCP as deputy governors. The NPC has taken a more assertive role in seeing who they want running in elections and who they do not. Elections matter only if they are *competitive*\n\nThere are also elections at the village level. You can't control everything, the central government thought, so they ceded power to elections (I'm sure the central government would control village-level politics if they could). These elections are more competitive than the township delegate elections. After three or four rounds of elections, Chinese villagers began to learn that elections are an easy way to get rid of unpopular leaders. But how much impact to village-level policy makers really have when their resources are controlled by the government right above them? Around 82% of villages today hold elections today. \n\n**TL;DR: Despite there being elections, they are semi-competitive at best, and only at the lowest levels of government, where the least important policy choices are made. The country is not democratic in how it lacks elections in the most important parts of the government.**\n\nWhat about free press? The media is largely controlled by the government under China Central Television (CCTV).  This is not a free media system, even thought he government allows producers some flexibilities. The people who run CCTV are appointed by the State, unlike other public broadcasting elsewhere (PBS, BBC, CBC). It's really tough to run editorials critical of the government, although more recently, there have been attempts. You know how Fox News broadcasters receive memos directing them what opinions their reporters should take? Imagine this on a large, institutionalized and unapologetic level with CCTV News, but this time the government is writing those memos. For example, recently, the government of China placed a quota on the number of entertainment shows in order to stifle the influx of \"Western culture\".\n\nWhat about free expression? Last year there were thousands of protests in China, but nearly all of these protests were launched against companies and local governments, not the central government. Those protesting the core and structure of the Chinese government (Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy activists like Ai Weiwei, Tan Zuoren, Cheng Jianping, Professor Guo Quan and Professor Liu Xiaobo) are quickly detained and jailed. The laws under which these activists are jailed include \"subversion of state power\", \"disturbing social order\", \"inciting social disorder\", and \"illegal possession of state secrets\".\n\nThe internet is a part of democracy, and expression in its truest form. The Chinese government is widely known to censor the internet (their efforts are known as the Great Firewall of China). The censorship efforts even come from non-state actors. Just as we may call militias and armed people fighting *for* a government a *paramilitary*, there is a *para-censhorship* group of internet users called the 50 Cent Party which takes it on themselves to post comments favorable towards CCP policies on internet message boards.\n\n**TL;DR: The television and internet media are strictly and controlled and regulated to favour the government. The country is not democratic because there is little press freedom. I want to say that this is changing, but the change is too slow to even take notice. There is very little freedom of political expression in China if that expression is critical of the government.**\n\n* **How engaged is the average Chinese citizen in the politics of their country? What do they think about their political situation?**\n\nWhat about the people? What do the people think of what's going on? They *define democracy differently*. If you begin to talk to a Chinese citizen about democracy, you'll find out in a few minutes that you two are talking about two totally different things. To the Chinese citizen, democracy means **socialist democracy**, which is more advanced than **liberal democracy**, because it's not victim to minority pressures and interests. The problem is that this leads to a tyranny of the majority. But Chinese citizens don't see that as a problem. The people (mass line) are the most important interest. Democracy is populism there, whereas here in the West, we're well aware of the dangers of populism (European democracies succumbed to fascism, and American democracy now suffers from those who are politicking for popularity). \n\nToday, 63% of Chinese believe the current regime is democratic, whereas 12% believe it is dictatorial. The Chinese trust their and outside NGOs, businesses, police and local governments the least, and the central government, the party and the army the most. This is because there are very weak labour protections in China, and companies many times don't pay employees the pensions they are entitled to. Local governments are most susceptible to corruption. The central government is seen as a 'father' that can right a wrong.  \n\n**TL;DR: The people largely support the central government, but not always the local governments and companies. They have a different idea of democracy that does not consider minority rights, and they believe this conception of democracy is better than Western decision making.**\n\n* **How do they view countries outside of China?**\n\nStay out of our business! You have to understand Chinese history to understand why the don't like other countries interfering in their politics and society. Britain was trying to pry open Chinese markets against the wishes of the administration to sell China addictive opium. This led to two wars in which China lost big time (including Hong Kong). Japan invaded China several times, leading to brutal occupations of the country's East Coast. China wants Taiwan back, but the West continues to apply pressure against it. Throughout history, other countries have meddled in China's domestic politics.\n\nBut so what! That's history. What do the people think?! Well, politicians use these historical *stories* to create memories in citizens for popular support. These historical stories also work psychologically, as Chinese continue to try to find dignity in their identities. History, and historical stories matter. The result is that Chinese citizens aren't all too happy with the outside world. They have a victimization mentality.\n\nUnless, that is, if outside relationships provide economic growth. China vigorously pursues trade and economic ties with other countries, namely for natural resources such as oil and metals. Their strong presence in Africa is for this purpose, but unlike the West, China doesn't attach strings to their trade with poorer African countries. Because they don't want to be told what to do, they don't tell others what should be done. Many cite the moral implications of dealing and fueling African and other dictatorships through this policy.\n\nAlthough a large part of China's relationship with the outside world is economic, it's not all that. China has been active in attempting to foster social relationships with the outside world by building Chinese language and culture schools abroad called Confucius Institutes. This policy, China hopes, would improve the West's understanding of China, in their attempts to improve their soft power.\n\n**TL;DR: The Chinese suffer from a victimization mentality that makes them oppose outside influence. Their relationship with outside actors are almost exclusively economic, although there are growing attempts at social relationships.\"\"**\n\n**ULTIMATE TL;DR: Shit's in lock-down, son.**",

        "text":"The nervous system and neurons are incredibly complex, here’s an overview to your question but let me know if you need more specifics\n\nThe autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates the body’s automatic functions like stomach and intestinal contractions. It is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Essentially the ANS helps maintain the body’s homeostasis. The sympathetic mainly controls the fight or flight response. Think about what would happen if you came across a tiger . You have two choices, you can fight the tiger, or run from it. Both would probably end in death, but let’s forget that for a second. So the sympathetic division of the ANS is responsible for dilating your pupils so more light can enter, it slows stomach movements so you can focus all energy on fighting or flighting here’s a [link](_URL_0_) to show you all of the effects. The para sympathetic division essentially does the opposite. Let’s say you do get away from the tiger. You’re probably going to want to resume functions like digestion, so that division will enable you to do that.\n\nAs for a nerve cell, here’s a [diagram](_URL_1_) the dendrites receive signals from other neurons and the cell then propagates the signal down to the axon and then passes it to the next cell. Neurons are located throughout the body but they are special cells that can’t reproduce after a certain age. They are supported by glial cells which perform other supporting functions in the nervous system. The way neurons communicate with each other is using neurotransmitters, chemicals that can communicate signals chemically between neurons and then use electricity to keep the signal going. Generally there are three types of neurons, sensory which are specialized to collect sensory information like cells in your eyes that receive light from the world around you and would be the first step in sensing  the tiger and activating the fight or flight. Motor neurons terminate on muscles and are how you move your body. They’re also responsible for the fight or flight response works like slowing your intestines. The third kind are located mainly in the brain and spine and are called inter neurons which help the sensory and motor neurons communicate.\n\nEdit for source: EMT",

FACS which is a way to identify human emotion can become used in the wrong way.  Some people could use it on others who don't want other people knowing how they feel.

They don't need a fancy device to tell them how that person is feeling.  Besides some people dont want you to know hoe they feel one day or maybe at all.  Peoples emotions can be kept to themselves and shouldn't be told to someone with a device instead they could just ask.  So this device isn't helpful to the world today. In today's society people dont want others knowing their emotions. If they want to know they can ask and if that person wants to tell them then they will. This device is an invasion on peoples privacy because not everyone wants you to know their feelings. This device wouldnt be used by very many people in the world today.  ",

        "text":"Ok, seeing as you've mentioned the Ashes, I'm going to explain test matches, but the basic rules apply to shorter forms of the game. First off: The game is played on a 'pitch' with is 22 yards long, with a set of three wooden stumps at each end. About a meter in front of the stumps is the 'crease', a white line which marks the 'safe' zone for the batsman. So long as a part of the batsman (including the bat) is touching the ground behind the crease, he will not be out if the stumps are broken with the ball by the fielding team (unless he is bowled - see ('batting')).\n\nIn a test match, each team may bat and bowl twice (two batting 'innings' each). \n\nThe object of the game is to make more runs across both innings than the opposing team. \n\n\n#Cricket Basics\n\nThere are two teams, comprised of 11 players. While one team is 'batting', the other is 'fielding'. \n\nOne member of the fielding team 'bowls' the ball to one of the batsmen, who then tries to hit it (or leave it at his discretion - there is no penalty for not hitting the ball).\n\n#Fielding\nThe 'fielding' team is arranged across the oval. They are trying to collect the ball once it is hit by the batsmen to prevent them scoring runs. They are also looking to catch it on the full where possible, after which a batsman will be out (see below in 'batting' for more detail). \n\nOne fielder gets to wear pads and gloves, and stands behind the stumps. He is called the 'wicketkeeper'. His job is the catch balls that the batsman misses or lets go.\n\nAt the other end is the **bowler**. He must deliver the ball to the batsman with a straight arm (less than 15 degrees of bend at the elbow), and generally on one bounce (although occasionally a ball will be hit before it bounces). He will bowl six times from one end of the pitch. This six ball period is called an **over**. Once the 'over' is complete, another bowler will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch. The wicketkeeper (and fielders) will change positions at the end of the over, but the batsmen will remain at their respective ends. Not every member of the team must bowl. Typically, a team will include five bowlers (one of whom may be an 'all-rounder' who is a decent bowler AND batsman). \n\n#Batting\nTwo members of the **batting** team are on the field at any given time. One stands at each end of the pitch. They are attempting to score **runs**. A run is scored when both batsmen run to the opposite end of the pitch from the one on which they were standing. Once the ball has been bowled, the batsmen may run as many times as they like. If the ball crosses the rope on the boundary on the full, 6 runs are awarded, and if the ball crosses the rope after touching the ground, 4 runs are awarded. The batsmen may run even if they have not hit the ball. These are called 'byes' (or 'leg byes if they hit a part of the batman's person other than his bat), and count towards the teams' score as an 'extra' (i.e. they are not awarded to the batsman who faced the ball and didn't hit it). \n\nEach batsman bats until he is **out**. There are several uncommon forms of dismissal, including 'handling the ball' (i.e. the batsman catching it or using his hand to block it without holding the bat), 'hit wicket' (where the batsman hits his own stumps) and 'timed out' (where a batsman takes more than three minutes to enter the field of play and face up to a ball). But these are rare. The most common forms of dismissal are:\n\n**Bowled** where the bowler bowls the ball and it hits the wickets;\n\n**caught** where the bowler bowls the ball, it is hit by the batsman, and caught by a fielder without touching the ground;\n\n*Leg Before Wicket* (LBW) where the ball is bowled, and hits the batsman's person in line with the stumps (i.e. would have hit the stumps if not for his leg, although it can be another part of the body if the batsman has ducked, for example);\n\n**Run Out** where the batsmen attempt to run, and the fielders hit the stumps with the ball at either end where the batsman at that end does not have his bat or a part of his body on the ground behind the 'crease'; and\n\n**Stumped** where the wicketkeeper breaks the stumps with the ball and the batsman facing has stepped outside his crease to play the ball, and missed it, and not re-entered his crease. \n\nOnce each batsman is out, he leaves the field of play, and may not bat again that innings. All eleven players may bat, and once there are ten out, the innings is over.",

        "text":"Il tabarro (The Cloak) is an opera in one act by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Giuseppe Adami, based on 's play La houppelande. It is the first of the trio of operas known as Il trittico. The first performance was given on December 14, 1918 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.\n\nRoles\n\nSynopsis\nPlace: A barge on the Seine in Paris.\nTime: 1910.\n\nIt is close to sunset in Paris, and the stevedores work unloading Michele's barge. Giorgetta, Michele's wife, asks her husband if she can bring wine to the workers. He agrees but does not join them because she refuses his kiss. The stevedores start dancing to the music of a nearby organ grinder and one of them steps on Giorgetta's foot. Luigi, a stevedore, dances with her, and it is evident that there is something between them. Upon hearing of Michele's return the stevedores' gathering breaks up.\n\nWork is getting scarce and Giorgetta and Michele discuss which of the stevedores should be dismissed; she prefers that it be anyone other than Luigi despite him being Michele's first choice. Soon the conversation turns into a fight. La Frugola enters, looking for Talpa, her husband and one of the stevedores. She shows everyone the fruits of her scavenging in Paris and scolds the men for their drinking. Luigi laments his lot in life, and La Frugola sings of her wish to one day buy a house in the country where she and her husband can retire. Giorgetta and Luigi sing a duet about the town where they were both born.\n\nThe stevedores depart except for Luigi, who asks Michele to dismiss him and let him off in Rouen, but Michele convinces him against this, saying there is not enough work in Rouen. When they are alone, Giorgetta asks Luigi why he requested to be dismissed; the pair acknowledge their love. They plan to meet later that evening upon the signal of a match being lit on board. By now Luigi seems determined to kill Michele and flee with Giorgetta.\n\nMichele later reminisces with Giorgetta of the days before their child died and how he could cover the two of them under his cloak. He is distressed about being twice her age; she comforts him but she still will not kiss him, and goes off.\n\nMichele wonders aloud if Giorgetta is still faithful to him and ponders who might have changed her so much. He reviews the list of men who have shared in their lives but dismisses each of them as improbable. Michele lights his pipe and Luigi, seeing it from afar, thinks that it is Giorgetta's signal. He returns to the barge and is confronted by Michele. In the ensuing fight, Michele disarms Luigi and forces him to confess his affair with Giorgetta before strangling him to death and hiding Luigi's body under his cloak. Giorgetta returns to the barge, approaching him remorsefully after their fight earlier, and when she is close enough Michele opens his cloak to reveal her dead lover, Luigi's lifeless body falling on Giorgetta. Michele smothers her to death on Luigi's body.\n\nArias\n\n \"È ben altro il mio sogno!\"—- Giorgetta\n \"Hai ben ragione! meglio non pensare\" — Luigi \n \"Nulla! Silenzio!\" — Michele\n \"Scorri, fiume eterno\" — Michele. This more contemplative aria for Michele was later replaced by Puccini with the vengeful \"Nulla!

        "text":"Can students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Yes, they can benefit from completing their work at home, and here are a few reasons for my position on this issue. Being able to have one on one time with your instructor, being able to work at your own pace   not being as social as others.  Firstly, I want to start with I know most people would say that students won't be able to get help. Which brings me to my first reason; being able to have one on one time with their instructors  This can improve the student's ability to understand something their having issues on. Teachers in schools have at least 25 students in their classes. So, when a student is having issues on a subject, it's hard for teachers to be able to teach them everything they need to know in order for them to comprehend the topic, and keep the class entertained and not get rowdy. Learning at home is a great opportunity to receive extra help.  Another reason is being able to work at your own pace. When having so many students in one class it may be hard to receive all the knowledge you need as fast as other students. All students work at different pace, and all students comprehend subjects differently. Most students at my school have this issue as well in class. The students that comprehended the lesson would tell the teacher they were comfortable to move on to another lesson, but other students were not. But instead of holding up the ones that were ready to move on they wouldn't say anything. Which made them fail tests, but if you were home schooled that wouldn't be an issue since there's no one there to rush you.  My final reason is a very common reason why students do home schooling. Which is not being as social as others also called bulling. Lots of people say when students leave school to home school it's going to be hard for them to make friends and learn social skills. My reason for picking this is because students that home school sometimes are being bullied, or can't make friends. It might also be hard to learn in class if their being bullied. I know a student from my school who had a lot of friends and was still bullied. Which made him end up being home schooled. Students that are home schooling because they don't have friends, or are being bullied are doing it because it allows them a comfortable and peaceful learning environment.  Attending classes from home is a great way to receive a better education if going to school isn't working. My reasons: being able to have one on one time, working at your own pace, and not being as social are just a few reasons why I think it is a good idea for students who want to try learning at home. ",

        "text":" Research happens any time you actively seek out information about a specific topic. You can research to explore a topic you're unfamiliar with, as well as to provide evidence for claims you're making in a presentation or research essay. Research can be collected by gathering your own data, reading online, or using previous research projects to guide your efforts.\n\n\n\nExploratory research is done when you read online, getting the quickest summary of the topic at hand. Say you were researching the general topic of \"obesity\" in the United States. To explore the topic, you might start with a Google search, read the wikipedia page, and find other web entries to get yourself familiar with the topic. What's the issue with obesity in the US? What arguments are being made about it? What other subjects are related to this topic? Health and fitness? Fast-food? What are you interested in researching further? In this kind of research, you're looking for facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupportive research occurs when you find those arguments in academic sources. What are academic sources? Anything that has been published, be it magazines, books, or the online database version of academic research journals. In this kind of research, you're looking for more than facts. You're looking for opinions and arguments of different sorts, related to your topic, that you can use to form an opinion and argument of your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Once you've explored a topic somewhat, there's still a lot you might not know, and this is what you can use to guide your research by forming a research question. Start asking lots of questions and writing them down: When people refer to the \"obesity epidemic,\" what are they referring to exactly? When did it start? Where? What are some possible reasons that it may exist?\n\n, Within every topic there is an \"issue,\" at stake. There's something debatable, something controversial about the topic, and that's what you want to spend time researching. The smaller, narrower, and more specific the topic, the better.\n\n\nThe topic of obesity in the US might be too large. Look at your own community, state, or region. What are the statistics? How does it compare to other regions? What might account for this? Why? If you're asking and answering these questions, you're well on your way to a solid research topic.\nIssues of fact don't make good research topics, because there's nothing to research, there's just a fact to look up. A good research question, for instance, wouldn't be \"How many people have died from obesity?\" but \"How does obesity kill?\"\n\n, After you've been exploring your topic online and possibly in print, you need to come up with a solid research question to help guide your supportive research.\"What policies and attitudes resulted in the sudden rise in obesity in Indiana during the mid-90s?\" would be an excellent research topic. It's specific in terms of location, controversy, and topic. It's something you can prove.\n\n, We all have strong opinions about topics, especially controversial ones. It can be tempting to only seek out sources that will validate your opinion, or that will oversimplify the topic, rather than complicate it. As you do your research, seek out a variety of opinions, arguments, and positions, and allow yourself to assemble the strongest possible research, not just the arguments you want to hear.\n\n, Depending on your topic, the Internet may be a wealth of information or a swampy region of opinions and comment streams. It's got the most current information available instantly, but it can also be difficult to distinguish between good sources and bad sources.\n\n\nGovernment websites (ones that end in .gov) are good sources of data and definitions. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention site, for instance, has lots of good data about obesity in the US, how the disease affects specific populations, and a breakdown of obesity by region.\nNon-profits (websites that end in .org) can also be good sources of opinions. Generally, organizations will have an \"agenda\" and will present a variety of information that backs up their position. This can be good in aiding your research, but can also feature a fair amount of spin on the issues.\nBlogs and message boards can be good for getting a sense of people's opinions and are good for coming up with ideas for questions you can ask yourself, but they're not good sources of support. They're not good for quotes, in other words.\n\n, Is obesity a disease? What do we mean by calling it an \"epidemic\"? These are terms you can and should look up quickly online. By defining your terms and becoming more familiar with the topic--becoming an amateur expert on it, in fact--you'll be more informed when you get to the much more technical kinds of sources you'll need to use for your supportive research.\n\n, One of the great things about a wiki (like wikiHow!) is that the sources referenced throughout the article are available at the bottom of the page for you to explore yourself. These are often better sources of information than the wiki itself, and the organization of the page allows for you to use it as a summary of the information in those sources, rather than a source unto itself.\n\n, When you're reading online, look for a mixture of statistics and data, as well as opinions. It's not necessarily helpful to have a ranting blog full of someone's conspiracies about growth hormones in school lunches being a conspiracy to keep kids obese, but there might be something there to inspire you. What is the deal with school lunches? What research has been done? Do more exploring and find a more substantial page with similar information.\n\n, The most helpful source of information at libraries isn't books. Often, librarians sit idly by while students struggle on computers not twenty feet away, digging through a difficult swamp of bad information and poor sources. Talk to them! They're here to help.\n\n\nBring your research question and any research you've done to this point, as well as any particular assignments or project descriptions that you've got with you. If you're doing research for a paper, bring the assignment sheet.\nAsk at the front desk for research librarians who are on-call for student consultations, or make an appointment yourself with a topic librarian in a specific field. These meetings tend to be very beneficial. You won't waste time trying to negotiate the difficult library databases, and you'll be sure the kind of information you find will be helpful for your project.\n\n, At the library, you've got more information that you'll know what to do with. Try to find only the most directly-related information. If you're struggling to find good sources, try refining your search terms and looking again.\n\n\nBooks obviously make for good overviews of topics. If you're researching obesity, you'll be able to find long-range research studies, expert analysis, and opinions on books in the subject.\nMagazines and research journals will provide more specialized and technical topics, usually at a somewhat shorter length. They're be lighter on opinion and heavier on dry statistics.\nMost university libraries use JSTOR or some variant of an academic database that houses research articles by topic. It can be a somewhat difficult database to negotiate, so talk to a librarian for help if you're unsure.\n\n, It can be frustrating when you first get started at the library in trying to find information directly related to your searches. Learning to search effectively and be diligent with your efforts will pay off in the end. Vary your searches, using quotations around specific searches you want the engine to look for. If you were looking for information about obesity, specifically related to the school lunch program, you might search for:\n\n\n\"obesity\"\n\"obesity\" \"school lunch\"\n\"school lunch\"\n\"junk food in schools\"\n\"Indiana obesity\"\n\"Indiana school lunches\"\n\"weight epidemic\"\n\"obesity epidemic\"\n\n, Learning to read quickly and skim effectively for important and on-topic information is often the difference between a smooth research project and a frustrating one. If you're getting deep into a really complicated technical topic, a lot of the research can be dry and downright boring. Learning to negotiate the sources quickly will make your job much easier.\n\n\nRead the abstract, if the source has one, or read the introduction to the source to make sure the topic is applicable. If it seems peripheral, put it back and forget about it. You're not doing research to pad your bibliography, you're doing it to support your argument and explore the topic.\nIf you find a good source, skip forward to the end and read the summary. Much of the \"meat\" of technical research-based sources will be spent presenting their own research, whereas you're mostly concerned with the findings and the argument itself. Often, you can get away with only reading a few paragraphs of a 15 or 20 page research report or book if you read smart.\nIf the source provides excellent support, read the article more closely to get a sense of the argument and the evidence. Use the author's own research to look for more sources.\n\n, There's nothing worse than getting to the writing phase of a research project at not being able to find a particular quote or statistic in the pile of research you've collected. Stay organized while you're researching and take careful notes to refer to later.\n\n\nTake note cards to the library and write down specific quotes on one side of the card and the bibliographical information (Title, author, publication info, and URL if applicable) on the other side of the card.\n\n, A good day at the library doesn't necessarily involve stacking up a mountain of 500-page books you'll never read. Research smart, taking notes on the most important parts of the information, and use a manageable number of sources to make your argument and serve your argument.\n\n\nSome students think more sources makes a research paper better. It doesn't. Ideally, you want a balance of \"their\" voice--meaning the research--and your voice, your argument. A good research project uses the research to form and support an argument, not to act like a ventriloquist dummy, repeating information you read at length.\n\n, Some topics and projects will call for primary research, which means that you'll collect the data yourself. If you've got a really localized topic--like the obesity problem at your University, for instance--you might want to consider creating a short questionnaire or other way of analyzing data of concern to your project., No surveys or questionnaires get to everyone. How many would be enough to get a good sense of the issue. Will it mean anything to gather opinions about obesity form 20 guys in the locker room? Everyone on your dorm floor? 300 people at the football game?\n\n\nBe conscious of bias. Aim for a somewhat distributed mix of men and women, of different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, and places of birth.\n\n, If you're after opinions, a questionnaire is the best and most efficient way of collecting data, but it might not be particularly applicable to your topic.\n\n\nIf you're interested in food habits and the availability of junk food in cafeterias, consider posting up beside the lunch line a few days a week and counting the number of students who forego the full lunches in favor of deserts, sodas, or candy. Keep a running tally.\nInterviews might be good if you have access to experts or other parties involved directly in the topic you're researching. If you want to learn about school lunches, talk to the lunch workers, the principal of your school, or other people who may be involved. Let them know what you're researching and explain the project before talking to them.\n\n, Once you've picked a method of collection, distribute your surveys, observe your behaviors, or conduct your interviews and collect your research. Analyze the research and summarize your findings in a way that you'll be able to use it for your research.\n\n\nIf your hypothesis about the research ends up being wrong, don't fret. This in and of itself can be a good source of information to present in a project, displaying your commitment to finding out \"the truth\" of the topic at hand.\n\n, When you've collected your research, identify the most persuasive arguments and sources and use them as a jumping off point for your own argument. If you found that districts with schools that feature vending machines experience a 30 percent higher obesity rate, how can you transition that into an argument to support with that research? What does the research say?, A thesis statement is the central thing you hope to prove by presenting your research. It should be debatable and specific, giving you a road map for where the research essay or project might go. A good thesis statement helps the writer as much as the reader, because it gives you a tangible thing to prove with the writing.\n\n\nA bad thesis statement might be \"Schools need to do more to avoid obesity.\" This is vague and difficult to prove. What schools? What do they need to do? \"Adams High School could significantly drop the obesity rate in the student body and even the region by removing the vending machines and offering a diversity of healthy choices\" does a lot more to present an argument and give you something to prove.\n\n, How do you present your research in a readable way?\n\n\nParaphrase to translate a source into your own words. These should always be attributed, but not quoted, and are most effective when you need to briefly summarize a position or argument. You've still given credit to the author, so we know the observation isn't your own. In other words, you might write:\n\nAccording to Adams, schools that feature vending machines in the lunch rooms experience an increase in obesity rates.\n\n\nQuote any language directly sourced from the article. This is effectively used when there's something in the wording of the source that you want to emphasize or highlight as part of your research:\n\nAccording to Adams, \"The inclusion of vending machines markedly increases the junk food desires of students in those schools, resulting in a chain reaction that rewards their bad choices.\"\n\n\nLearn to recognize and avoid plagiarism. It can happen accidentally, so you need to learn to recognize the ways in which it occurs and avoid it.\n\n, If you're writing a research essay, you need to learn to effectively provide citation information for each source you reference, be it paraphrase or quotation, throughout the source. Use a parenthetical or footnote citation in the text of your paper, and include a list of references or a Works Cited page at the end of the paper including the publishing information for each source. Your teacher may want you to use a particular style of citation, but the most popular include:\n\n\nMLA\nAPA\nChicago Style\nTurabian\n\n",

For each eye, single-frame (without signal\naveraging), and multi-frame (75x signal averaging) volume scans were obtained.\nA custom deep learning network was then designed and trained with 2,328 \"clean\nB-scans\" (multi-frame B-scans), and their corresponding \"noisy B-scans\" (clean\nB-scans + gaussian noise) to de-noise the single-frame B-scans. The performance\nof the de-noising algorithm was assessed qualitatively, and quantitatively on\n1,552 B-scans using the signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio\n(CNR), and mean structural similarity index metrics (MSSIM).\n  Results: The proposed algorithm successfully denoised unseen single-frame OCT\nB-scans. The denoised B-scans were qualitatively similar to their corresponding\nmulti-frame B-scans, with enhanced visibility of the ONH tissues. The mean SNR\nincreased from $4.02 \\pm 0.68$ dB (single-frame) to $8.14 \\pm 1.03$ dB\n(denoised). For all the ONH tissues, the mean CNR increased from $3.50 \\pm\n0.56$ (single-frame) to $7.63 \\pm 1.81$ (denoised). The MSSIM increased from\n$0.13 \\pm 0.02$ (single frame) to $0.65 \\pm 0.03$ (denoised) when compared with\nthe corresponding multi-frame B-scans.\n  Conclusions: Our deep learning algorithm can denoise a single-frame OCT\nB-scan of the ONH in under 20 ms, thus offering a framework to obtain superior\nquality OCT B-scans with reduced scanning times and minimal patient discomfort.\n",

As an illustration, we consider\nthe problems of testing the absence of serial correlation in multiple-output\nand possibly non-linear regression (an extension of the classical Durbin-Watson\nproblem) and the sequential identification of the order $p$ of a vector\nautoregressive (VAR($p$)) model. A Monte Carlo comparative study of our tests\nand their routinely-applied Gaussian competitors demonstrates the benefits (in\nterms of size, power, and robustness) of our methodology; these benefits are\nparticularly significant in the presence of asymmetric and leptokurtic\ninnovation densities. A real data application concludes the paper.\n",

That's great.\n\n > Now you're fucked.\n\n > No really.\n\n > You are.\n\n > You're fucked.\n\nIgnoring the non-monetary things that can happen, the example of Jack Whittaker is quite an illustrative one. He won $315 million ($114 mil after choosing the lump sum + paying tax), but even before then he had a net worth of $15mil and was the owner of a successful contracting firm. Surely someone whose net worth is *that much* knows how to budget, right?\n\nSure. So long as you ignore all the pleading - I've got MS, my daughter's got cancer, I'm unemployed and just need a jumpstart with money. Not just in letters, but in person. Whittaker abandoned going to his usual breakfast place because he would always be accosted. Then they showed up at his door, and he had to hire security personel.\n\nAnd that was just the start. Imagine having your face, name, and location posted in the news. Anyone with a bit of sleuthing could find your home and start tracking or stalking you. Extended family (some of whom you've not heard of in years, if not *decades*) could come out of the woodwork wanting to share in your fortune. People accosting close family members because they're easier to get to than you, or breaking into your house to steal goods or cash.\n\nAnyone who is aware of your fortune is almost inevitably going to want money. And either you hire a go-between to deal with it (money), you have a stone cold heart and can say no a hundred times a day, or you give to those you believe are 'needy' and watch more people come and ask while your fortune is whittled away.\n\nThen, of course, you've got the people who have no idea how to manage money. Two, three, five million? More than they could ever hoped to imagine. They can buy a fancy house, a nice car, maybe a luxury yaht...but where's all the money to *maintain* that going to come from? A luxury holiday in a five-star hotel with first class flight tickets sounds great, but four years later you're back to your old habit of camping because all the money is *gone*.\n\nIf you're also one of the demographic that doesn't earn that much money, you might not have any idea that there are people whose *entire job* is managing rich peoples' money. So they make spur of the moment financial decisions that inevitably lead to a short-term extravagant lifestyle, followed by bankrupcy.",

About a month before formal get your dress. There are various types of formal dresses for different body types and styles. Choose the dress that you love and you feel the most confident and comfortable in.;\n, Traditionally, guys wear tuxedos or suits to formal dances. A formal that is considered a black tie event usually means you should wear a tux. You should only wear a tux for an evening event. A suit is more casual and is considered appropriate for day time or night time occasions. Tuxedos are more expensive than suits, but you can rent one if you just need it for one evening. , Don’t dye your hair right before formal because you never know what could go wrong. You will want time to fix any mistakes, so dye your hair weeks in advance. Don’t cut your hair too close to the day of the dance, especially don’t do anything drastic the day of.\n\n, The weeks leading up to the dance look at hair styles online that you think you can do yourself. Buy any necessary supplies you will need to do the hair style beforehand (curlers, products, hair spray, bobby pins). Practice the weeks leading up to it to make sure you can do the hair style perfectly when the night of the formal arrives. , Look at makeup styles online that you like and buy the makeup you will need to execute the look. Practice before the dance so you can get it perfect the day of. Wear the amount of makeup you feel comfortable in. You can go to your formal in no makeup if you would like or a lot of makeup, it is up to you. The important part is that you feel comfortable and beautiful on your night.\n\n\nMake sure to prime your face, eyes, and lips and use a setting spray to keep everything in place. You don’t want your makeup melting off of your face when you start dancing.\nUse a foundation that is specifically for photos (you can find this at any makeup or drug store), since there will be a lot of memories being captured at formal. Make sure to blend your foundation well and have it match your skin tone. , If you don’t think you can get the look you want on your own, make appointments. You can make a hair appointment at a salon, makeup appointment with a makeup artist, and a nail appointment at a nail salon. Weeks before the event schedule the appointments, otherwise everything might be booked. This option is costlier than doing your hair and makeup yourself. , You don’t need a date for a formal dance, but if you want one start figuring out who you might want to take in advance. If you don’t have a significant other, think about a friend you could ask to go with you as your date or who you think might ask you. Choose someone who you think you will have fun with and who will make sure you have a great night.\n\n\nAsk your friends for help to find you the perfect date.\nAsk someone yourself if nobody has asked you. The worse thing that can happen is that they say no. , You don’t need a date to have a great time at formal, going with your friends can be more fun for a lot of reasons. Going with your friends instead of a date means there is no stress about if you and your date are going to have fun and click. You can feel comfortable being yourself and dancing how you want. Without a date, you can dance with whoever you want. After the dance you can spend time with your friends and not worry about any pressure from your date to hang out. , Whether you go with just your friends or with a date, go to the dance in a group. Plan your group a few weeks before the dance. Ask your friends, your dates’ friends, and their dates if they want to go to the formal together. You can do the pre-formal and post-formal activities together to make your formal experience even more fun.\n\n, Once you have your formal group determined you can decide where you want to take photos before the formal. There are many different places you can take the photos: a backyard, rooftop, bridge, staircase, beach, lake, or garden are popular places. . Decide who you want to take the photos. Parent’s typically love to take photos or if you want, and have the budget, you can hire a professional photographer.\n\n, Have dinner somewhere that everyone in your group likes before formal. The restaurant should be near where the formal is located. Once everyone has agreed on a place, make reservations ahead of time because the popular restaurants fill up quickly.\n\n, There are many options for getting to formal, depending on your budget. Your group can all go in on a limo or party bus if you have a big enough budget. You can drive yourselves if you have enough cars. If you live somewhere where shared ride services are available, such as Uber or Lyft, you can use that to get to formal.\n\n, What you do after formal is entirely up to you. It is a good idea to have an idea in mind of what you want to do. You can have or go to a party - either a small get together with your close friends or a big party, whatever you prefer.\n\n\nHave a sleepover with your best friends after formal.\nReminisce about your favorite memories from the dance around a bonfire.\nDo something not fancy in your fancy clothes.

        "text":"Nescopeck Creek is a  tributary of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The creek is in the Coal Region of Pennsylvania. The meaning of the creek's name is \"deep black waters\". The waters of Nescopeck Creek have difficulty ratings between Class I and Class III. However, during parts of the year, Nescopeck Creek is impossible to navigate due to rapids, flooding, and tight bends. Nescopeck Creek is home to a number of species of trout, although the waters are not always optimal for them. Nescopeck Creek's water is acidic, with a pH as low as 3.6 in some studies.\n\nMuch of the land in the Nescopeck Creek's watershed is forest. Farmland is common in the lower portions of the Nescopeck Creek watershed and the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed, while coal mines are more common on Nescopeck Creek's tributaries Black Creek, Stony Creek, and Cranberry Creek. A  portion of Nescopeck Creek is considered a cold-water fishery of high quality. There are also seven natural areas in the creek's watershed, some of which contain rare species of plants and animals. On the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, the streams in the watershed range from 0 to 18. There are 51 genera of macroinvertebrates in the creek's watershed. The habitats in the watershed primarily include mixed forest.\n\nNescopeck Creek's watershed is  in area and lies in parts of three counties. Slightly over half of the land in the watershed is deciduous forest. The rest is perennial herbaceous vegetation, mixed vegetation and annual herbaceous vegetation, and barren land. Some sub-watersheds contain as much as 80 percent forest. Almost all of the streams in the watershed are within  of a road. Most of the land in the watershed has a slope of 0 to 3 percent, although there are areas with a slope of 8 percent or more.\n\nThere are five main soil series in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. These are the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series, the Wellsboro-Oquaga-Morris series, the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series, the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series, and the Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series. There are also coal veins in the watershed. The creek discharges aluminum, iron, and manganese, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The pH of the streams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed range from 4.2 to 7.2. The main stem's discharge ranged from  between 1919 and 1926. There are 10 dams in the watershed.\n\nCourse\n\nNescopeck Creek begins in Dennison Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, at the confluence of an outlet of Olympus Pond and Creasy Creek. The creek's source is also on the eastern edge of Mount Yeager. It flows northwest for a short distance before passing through Olympus Pond and turning west. For the next several miles the creek continues in this direction, running through Pennsylvania State Game Lands #18 and receiving tributaries such as Reilly Creek and Little Nescopeck Creek A. Eventually, the creek passes the northwestern edge of Mount Yeager and continues into Butler Township.  Here, the creek heads southwest at a more southerly angle, crossing Interstate 80, receiving Oley Creek, and passing an area of strip mines. A few miles later, the creek turns west-southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 309. Continuing onwards, it passes the communities of Rumbels and St. Johns and then crosses Interstate 81. Several miles later, the creek leaves Butler Township and enters Sugarloaf Township.  It continues west in this township, receiving the tributary Little Nescopeck Creek B, crossing Pennsylvania Route 93, and making several meanders. After a number of miles, the creek meanders into Black Creek Township, where it turns north and picks up the tributary Black Creek right before crossing Interstate 80 and flowing through a gap in Nescopeck Mountain. In the gap, the creek crosses from Black Creek Township into Nescopeck Township, where it meanders northwest, passing the borough of Nescopeck and entering the Susquehanna River on the border between Nescopeck Township and Columbia County.\n\nTributaries\nNescopeck Creek has more than  of tributaries. This consists of  of named streams and  of unnamed ones. Major streams include Black Creek, two tributaries named Little Nescopeck Creek, Oley Creek, Creasy Creek, and Long Run. There are 13 named streams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed.\n\nThe portion of Nescopeck Creek from its mouth upstream to the mouth of Black Creek has a Strahler number of 5. This makes up  of the streams in the watershed. Most of Black Creek and almost all of Nescopeck Creek upstream of Black Creek has a Strahler number of 4. These make up  of streams in the creek's watershed. Eight smaller tributaries in the watershed have Strahler number of three. These make up  of the creek's watershed. A total of 25 streams in the creek's watershed have a Strahler number of 2. They make up  of the creek's watershed. One hundred thirteen very small streams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed have a Strahler number of 1. Such streams make up  of the creek's watershed.\n\nLittle Nescopeck Creek A is one tributary of Nescopeck Creek. Its source is at the very northwestern edge of the creek's watershed, and it joins the main stem of Nescopeck Creek slightly downstream of Olympus Pond. Little Nescopeck Creek B is in the south of the watershed and is slightly longer than Little Nescopeck Creek A. Little Nescopeck Creek B joins Nescopeck Creek at Sybertsville. Black Creek is the longest tributary of Nescopeck Creek, with a length of . Reilly Creek is a tributary of Nescopeck Creek in the extreme east of the creek's watershed. Only  long, it is the shortest named tributary of Nescopeck Creek.\n\nHydrology\n\nDischarge\nFrom 1919 to 1926, the discharge of Nescopeck Creek at St. Johns was . The month with the highest average discharge during this time was March, when there was a discharge of . The month with the lowest average discharge during this time was September, when there was an average discharge of . The highest discharge in a single month was  in March 1920. The lowest discharge in a single month was  in September 1922. The average discharge of Nescopeck Creek from 1995 to 2002 is . From 1996 to 1998, the Jeddo Tunnel discharged an average of  of water into Little Nescopeck Creek.\n\nDams\nThere are ten dams on Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The impoundments behind these dams have surface areas of . Nine of the dams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are made from earthen-fill. The tenth is an unnamed dam constructed of masonry. The dams range from  in height and  in length. Their drainage areas are between .\n\npH and contaminants\nIn 2005, a study was done on the pH of the waters of Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. At three sites, its pH averaged 5.06, 4.85, and 4.49. However, the pH at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters is between 6.5 and 7. The lowest pH level in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is 4.2, which is on some parts of Black Creek. Creasy Creek is the most alkaline tributary of Nescopeck Creek, with a pH ranging from 6.9 to 7.2. Other relatively alkaline streams in the creek's watershed include Long Run (6.6), Reilly Creek (6.4), Long Hollow (6.4), Oley Creek (6.4), Conety Run (6.2), and Little Nescopeck Creek A (5.8 to 7). Brook trout are able to tolerate pHs down to 4.8 and the ideal pH range for freshwater fish is 6.5 to 9.0.\n\nAt these sites, the study also found averages of 1.7, 2.23, and 5.56 parts per million of aluminum, respectively. Concentrations of aluminium higher than 100 to 200 parts per million can cause suffocation of fish by accumulating in their gills. The toxicity of aluminum to fish is increased by a water pH of below 4.5 to 6.5. There were also 0.65, 0.81, and 1.84 parts per million of iron in these sites, and 0.96, 1.15, 0.03, and 2.65 parts per million of manganese. There were 91.37, 114.27, and 274.1 milligrams per liter of sulfates in the waters of Nescopeck at these sites.\n\nA total of  of nitrogen per year are discharged from Nescopeck Creek. Thirty-three percent of this came from land, 60 percent from groundwater, and 6 percent from leaking septic tanks. Its Black Creek tributary adds toxic amounts of copper, lead, and zinc to Nescopeck Creek's watershed. In most parts of Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries, the concentration of phosphorus is slightly lower than the concentration of nitrogen. However, at St. Johns and Conyngham, the phosphorus level is considerably higher than the nitrogen level. Most phosphorus contributed to Nescopeck Creek comes from sub-watersheds instead of the main stem of the creek. The total amount of phosphorus in Nescopeck Creek is . Cropland and quarries are the largest land sources of phosphorus in the watershed, each contributing  (43.6 percent of land sources) and . The smallest sources of phosphorus in the watershed are unpaved roads, contributing  (0.1 percent) and mixed forest, contributing  (0.2 percent). Groundwater contributes  and septic systems contribute . Point source pollution in the watershed does not release any phosphorus.\n\nStony Creek's water is the hardest water in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, with a concentration of over 100 milligrams per liter of dissolved minerals. Other streams in the watershed with hard water are Reilly Creek (28 milligrams per liter) and Long Run (21 milligrams per liter). Some of the least hard waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are those of Little Nescopeck Creek A (3 to 8 milligrams per liter), Conety Run (5 milligrams per liter), and Oley Creek (7 milligrams per liter). However, the largest source of pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is acid mine drainage (AMD).\n\nAbove Little Nescopeck Creek B, Nescopeck Creek's iron concentration is 110 micrograms per liter and the creek's aluminum concentration is 40 micrograms per liter. Below Little Nescopeck Creek B, however, these values increase to 1260 micrograms per liter for iron and 7450 micrograms per liter for aluminum.\n\nThe vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed has been measured using the DRASTIC system. It is lowest in the headwaters, as well as patches near the creek's mouth, with a value of 69 to 90. Values of 91 to 104 occur in the northern part of the watershed, as well as in scattered patches in the western part. Values of 105 to 115 occur in the southern, southwestern, and part of the central part of the watershed. Some areas with values 116 and higher are scattered throughout the watershed except near the headwaters.\n\nGeology\nNescopeck Creek has coal veins near its source. These coal veins first appeared 300 million years ago. The thickness of these coal seams ranges from  in the Tracy Bed up to  in the Mammoth Bed. Nearly all of the Eastern Middle coal field is in the watershed of Nescopeck Creek. Sugarloaf Mountain is near Nescopeck Creek. Nescopeck Creek has a number of rapids. At its mouth, Nescopeck Creek carries  of aluminum,  of iron, and  of manganese per day.\n\nNescopeck Creek is in the geological region known as the Ridge and Valley region. This region is characterized by fertile valleys and steep ridges. However, the eastern reaches of the Nescopeck Creek watershed are near the border of the Appalachian Plateau region.\n\nNescopeck Creek's watershed contains several major rock formations. These are the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pocono Formation, and the Pottsville Formation. The Mauch Chunk Formation is associated with large amounts of high-quality groundwater. This formation consists of a  layer of shale, sandstone, and silt. It is situated under the Hazleton valley. The Mauch Chunk Formation contains outcrops of reddish rock. This formation is softer than many of the nearby rock formations. This formation makes up Sugarloaf Mountain and most of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Llewellyn Formation contains more coal than any other formation in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. This formation is  thick and is composed of brownish-gray sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Buck Mountain, Mammoth Mountain, and Gamma Mountain are all carved out of the Llewellyn Formation and contain coal seams. The formation was once extensive but has been worn down by erosion over millions of years. The Pottsville Formation also contains a large number of aquifers. This formation is  thick, and is composed of gray conglomerate and sandstone. While there is no anthracite in the Pottsville Formation, it does contain three-foot seams of other varieties of coal. Groundwater from this formation is acidic and high in manganese and iron. The Pottsville Formation makes up the valleys directly surrounding Nescopeck Creek. The Pocono Formation consists of conglomerate and sandstone and surrounds the Pottsville Formation. The rock formations are typically more varied in the northern and western part of the watershed than the southern part.\n\nThere are also several less significant rock formations in Nescopeck Creek's watershed. These include the Spechty Kopf Formation, the Hamilton Formation, and the Catskill Formation. Little is understood about the Spechty Kopf Formation, but it occurs between the Catskill and Pocono Formations. The Catskill Formation is grayish-red shale, siltstone, and sandstone.\n\nA total of  of material have eroded into Nescopeck Creek. Black Creek has the most erosion for an individual stream in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, with  of erosion. The main stem of Nescopeck Creek and Little Nescopeck Creek B also have high amounts of erosion, with  and , respectively.\n\nSoils\n\nThe most common soil series in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is the Hazleton-Dekalb-Buchanan series. Twenty-six percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed contains this soil series. Much soil and bedrock in this series has been removed during mining operations. This soil series occurs in the southern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, near tributaries such as Black Creek and Stony Creek. The soils in this soil series are highly permeable.\n\nApproximately 24 percent of the creek's watershed contains the Wellsboro-Oquaga-Morris series. The series is made of Wellsboro soils, Oquaga soils, and some Morris soils. This type of soil series is most common near the creek's source. Another twenty-four percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed is made up of the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. This soil series tends to occur on hillsides near streams. The Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series occurs quite near the mouth of Nescopeck Creek, with a large patch further upstream, and a small patch in the southwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed.\n\nEleven percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed is made up of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas where this soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth in this series is the rocky surface and the depth of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.\n\nWatershed\nNescopeck Creek's watershed is  in area. Most of the watershed is in Luzerne County, but part of it also extends into Schuylkill and Columbia Counties. Nescopeck Creek's watershed area includes one city, five boroughs, and thirteen townships. Most of the land in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, except for area near its source, is publicly owned. Thirteen percent of the land in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is owned by the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nFifty-seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed is composed of deciduous forest. Areas of perennial herbaceous vegetation make up 11 to 12 percent of the creek's watershed. Additionally, there are scattered patches of mixed vegetation and annual herbaceous vegetation in the northwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Four to seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed consists of mines, quarries, and gravel pits.\nA total of 95 percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed is rural. The remaining 5 percent is suburban or urban. Twenty-seven percent of the streams in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are near surface-mining operations and 73 percent are not. Most developed land tends to be located in the southern part of the watershed, while most undeveloped land is in the northern part of the watershed.\n\nAll sub-watersheds of the Nescopeck Creek watershed contain at least 50 percent forest. A number of streams in the upper Nescopeck Creek watershed, in fact, have more than 80 percent forest coverage. Only 55 percent of the Black Creek watershed is covered by forest. Most sub-watersheds of Nescopeck Creek have only a small amount of barren land. However, the Cranberry Creek watershed contains 6.5 percent barren land, the Black Creek watershed contains 14 percent, and the Stony Creek watershed contains 30 percent. The Little Nescopeck Creek watershed contains 30 percent farmland and the Nescopeck Creek watershed contains 24 percent. Other sub-watersheds of Nescopeck Creek range from 2 to 13 percent farmland.\n\nThere are  of roads in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Forty percent of the creek's length is within  of a road. Eighty-seven percent of Nescopeck Creek's length is within  of a road. There are  of roads in Nescopeck Creek's main stem sub-watershed. There are  of roads in the Black Creek sub-watershed. The Long Run and Little Nescopeck Creek sub-watersheds also contain close to  of roads, respectively.\n\nTerrain\nMost of the Nescopeck Creek watershed is flat, with a slope of 0 to 3 percent. There are two major lines of hills in the watershed, one of which is in the northern part and the other of which is in the central part of the watershed. These lines of hills have a slope of 3 to 8 percent. In both of the lines of hills, there are patches where the slope is 8 to 15 percent and in the northern line of hills, there is an area with a slope of over 15 percent.\n\nThe elevation at Nescopeck Creek's mouth and along Nescopeck Creek for a few miles upstream is in the range of  above sea level. The elevation of the creek's watershed north of the northernmost line of hills is in the range of . The central part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, south of the northernmost line of hills, including the mouth of Black Creek, is also in this range. The area close to the main stem of the creek upstream to several miles from the source is in the range of . In the central part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed, several tributaries also lie in this elevation range. Near the creek's source, its elevation is in the range of . The central part of the Black Creek watershed is also in this range, as is much of the Nescopeck Creek watershed's northernmost line of hills. Nescopeck Creek's elevation within  of its source is in the range of . The upper portion of the Black Creek watershed and the southeastern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed is also in this range. Scattered parts of the creek's watershed, such as its southwestern corner and the creek's source, are in the elevation range of .\n\nThe Long Hollow sub-watershed is Nescopeck Creek is Nescopeck Creek's smallest sub-watershed, with an area of . The main stem of Nescopeck Creek has the largest sub-watershed, with an area of . The Black Creek sub-watershed is Nescopeck Creek's second-largest sub-watershed. The Little Nescopeck Creek A at , Little Nescopeck Creek B at , Cranberry Creek at , and Oley Creek at  are also among the largest Nescopeck Creek sub-watersheds.\n\nHistory\n\nNative American inhabitation\nNescopeck Creek's name comes from a Lenape word meaning \"deep black waters\". Historically, two tribes of Native Americans known as the Fork Indians and the Delaware Indians lived near the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. Other parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed were settled by Lenni Lenape Indians. The Lenni Lenape inhabited the Nescopeck Creek watershed a thousand years before European settlers. There is no definitive record of permanent settlements in the interior of Nescopeck Creek's watershed, but temporary Native American settlements existed in what is now Nescopeck State Park. By the 1700s, the Lenni Lenape had left the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to encroaching Iroquois and European settlers.\n\nThere were two major Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. These were the Lehigh Path, which is also known as the Warrior Trail, and the Trade Trail. Parts of these trails would become Vine Street and Broad Street in Hazleton, respectively.\n\nEuropean inhabitation\nIn the early 1700s, some European settlers, who were granted warrants by William Penn, explored Native American trails in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. On these paths, skirmishes occasionally occurred between settlers and Native Americans. One example is the Sugarloaf Massacre, when a group of Native Americans ambushed some soldiers on the Lehigh Path near Nescopeck Creek in 1780. The first mill was built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed in 1788. By 1791, there were four settlers along Nescopeck Creek. In 1795, Samuel Mifflin built a sawmill at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. A gristmill was built on Nescopeck Creek the same year. A flood of Nescopeck Creek in 1786, known as the Pumpkin Flood, was noted for sweeping large numbers of pumpkins downstream on the creek.\n\nLight industries, such as lumbering and tanning, gradually developed in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. This led to the creation of numerous communities in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, such as White Haven, Freeland, and Hazleton. Additionally, anthracite coal was discovered in 1813. Coal became an important industry for the Nescopeck Creek region by 1836 with the formation of the Hazleton Coal Company. In the 1830s and 1840s, a number of \"patch towns\" designed to attend mines were built in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The population in the Nescopeck Creek watershed began to increase rapidly around this time. By the 1880s, the patch towns attended over thirty mines in the watershed. However, the coal mining industry in the watershed began to lose value around this time, coal mining was no longer a significant source of industry in the Nescopeck Creek watershed by 1936.\n\nIn 1830, a forge which made bar iron was built on Nescopeck Creek. The most destructive flood on Nescopeck Creek occurred in 1850, when a dam on the creek was breached, killing 22 people. From 1858 to 1870 there was a tannery on Nescopeck Creek. In 1828, plans for a canal in Nescopeck Creek were made. In 1885, a number of French Indian artifacts, which were Plaster of Paris casts for making sculptures, were discovered along Nescopeck Creek in Dennison Township.\n\nIn 1891 the first part of the Jeddo Tunnel, a tunnel in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, was built. The last tunnel in this system was built in 1932. These tunnels drain more than , of which  contain coal basins.\n\nA dam on Nescopeck Creek was destroyed during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, there was a steam-electric power station at the mouth of Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek in the beginning of the 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.\n\nBiology\nNescopeck Creek is home to brown trout and brook trout near its source, but does not have much life further downstream because coal mine waste in Little Nescopeck Creek pollutes the lower reaches of Nesocpeck Creek. In 1999, a study discovered 20 species of fish living in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Of these, 15 had been observed before in the watershed, and five had not. Nesopeck Creek and its various tributaries are rated Class A to Class D for wild trout. There are a number of riparian buffers on Nescopeck Creek, of which 80 percent consist of forest. Along parts of Nescopeck Creek, there are a large number of shrub-like oak trees. In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, there are prolific forests of oak, chestnut, and hemlock trees.\n\nThe entire Nescopeck Creek watershed has a high level of biodiversity, with the most diverse areas being Arbutus Peak, the Edgewood vernal pools, and the Nescopeck Creek valley. The creek's southeastern corner contains the highest density of amphibian species in its watershed. The highest density of snake species in the watershed is in the same area. The lowest density of snake species in the watershed is along the central part of Nescopeck Creek. The highest density of bird species in the watershed is in the southern and central part of the watershed. The highest density of mammal species in the watershed is at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters.\n\nIn the Nescopeck Creek watershed, there are seven natural areas. These are Arbutus Peak, Valmont Industrial Park, the Black Creek flats, the Humboldt barrens, the Nescopeck Creek valley, and the Edgewood vernal pools. Arbutus Peak is a  area at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters. Also, the Nescopeck Barrens are home to 15 rare species of plants and animals. The Nescopeck Creek valley also contains a number of rare species. The Edgewood vernal pools provide a breeding ground for wood frogs and Jefferson salamanders.\n\nThe Bird Community Index, a measure of the quality of a habitat based on the presence of songbirds, has been tested for most of the watershed of Nescopeck Creek. The Bird Community Index was high in one area near the source of Nescopeck Creek. In all other areas of the watershed, the index was low to medium. One of the lowest values is near Nescopeck Creek's mouth. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (HBI) has been measured for a number of sites along Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. Upstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, Little Nescopeck Creek B has a high HBI. However, just downstream of the Jeddo Tunnel, the HBI drops off by a large amount. Black Creek has an HBI of 0 to 6.6, and this tributary's biodiversity is lower at its headwaters than at its confluence with Nescopeck Creek. Nescopeck Creek's HBI is from 1.7 to 5.4, depending on the site. In Nescopeck Creek, the total number of macroinvertebrate taxa at several sites ranges from 5 to 26. In Little Nescopeck Creek, the values range from 1 to 18. In Black Creek, the number ranges from 0 to 11.\n\nIn 1999, the only Class-A fishery waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, as well as most of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.\n\nA large number of genera of macroinvertebrates have been discovered in and around Nescopeck Creek. These consist of one genus of segmented worm, one genus of sowbugs, 11 genera of mayflies, 8 genera of stone flies, 11 genera of caddisflies, 6 genera of dragonflies, 2 genera of helgrammites, 10 genera of beetles, and one genus of fly.\n\nThere are a total of 14 species of amphibians in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, of which 11 breed in the watershed. These species consist of 6 salamanders, 6 frogs, one newt, and one toad. There are seven species of reptiles in the watershed, of which five breed there. Five of these species are snakes and two are turtles. The biodiversity of birds in the watershed is much greater than that of amphibians or reptiles; there are approximately one hundred different species of birds in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. A total of 29 mammals have been observed in the creek's watershed, including three species of bats, two species of mice, and two species of foxes.\n\nHabitats\nThe most common habitat in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this habitat include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak. This habitat also contains gray and black birch trees. Pine, hemlock, and some types of oak trees are found on the higher parts of this habitat. Lower to the ground are huckleberry, teaberry, blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this habitat include wild onion and wild strawberries.\n\nIn the Nescopeck Creek watershed, pitch pine – scrub oak forests occur on Arbutus Peak and several barren areas in the southern part of watershed. In this type of forest, pitch pine, scrub oak, black oak and chestnut oak are the main trees. Bracken fern, teaberry, black chokeberry, blueberry, and huckleberry are the most common shrubs in this habitat.\n\nAll of the streams in the Nescopeck Creek are considered sub-optimal habitats and rated on a scale of 1 to 240. The most optimal water habitat in the watershed is a site along Nescopeck Creek, with a rating of 184. The least optimal water habitats in the watershed are two sites along Black Creek. These sites are considered poor to marginal habitats, with ratings of 56 and 96 respectively.\n\nRecreation\nNescopeck State Park is one source of recreation in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Nescopeck Creek flows through this state park and on it there are opportunities for trout fishing. Nescopeck Creek takes up  of the northwestern part in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Additionally, there are four golf courses, two community parks, and two Pennsylvania State Game Lands, and ten sites for water-based recreation, including Lake Francis in Nescopeck State Park. A tourist attraction, Eckley Miner's Village, is within the Nescopeck Creek watershed. A resort known as the Eagle Rock Resort is in the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Since the late 1990s, there have been plans to convert old railroad lines in the Nescopeck Creek watershed to rail trails. One such plan is to link the Hazleton area to the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor.\n\nSee also\nBriar Creek (Susquehanna River), next tributary of the Susquehanna River going downriver\nSalem Creek, next tributary of the Susquehanna River going upriver\nList of rivers of Pennsylvania\nNescopeck State Park\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\nNescopeck Creek Watershed Stewardship Report (Spring 2002).

        "text":" When you eat small meals throughout the day, your stomach has to produce less acid to digest the food. Less acid means your stomach is less likely to become irritated, so you are less likely to feel nauseous.Eating a large meal can also distend your abdomen, which can actually trigger feelings of nausea that could lead to vomiting.;\n, You should generally avoid strong-smelling foods if you are concerned about hyperemesis gravidarum. Cold foods generally have less of an aroma than hot foods, so stick to cold dishes. While this might be frustrating, it is most likely worth it if you want to avoid becoming nauseous., Spicy food and oily foods can make your gastrointestinal system produce more acid. This is because the spices and oils from the food agitate the walls of the stomach, causing your stomach and pancreas to secrete more bile. Due to the excess production of these digestive acids, the vomiting center in the brain gets activated and can cause hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\n, Fatty foods take a longer time to digest, which means that they slow down your digestive system and can increase the amount of acid your stomach is producing.More acid can mean that you will begin to feel more nauseous. Fatty foods include:\n\n\nFried foods, animal products like lard, commercially-baked cakes and pastries, vegetable shortening, and margarine., Some foods have stronger smells than others. Everyone is different, so you will have to keep track of the foods that smell a little too strongly for your taste., Nausea can be triggered by thirst and hunger, so it is important to stay hydrated if you are concerned about becoming nauseous. Drink your beverage of choice in small sips as chugging a bunch of water can also make you feel nauseous.If you are bored with water, you can add a small amount of fruit juice to the water to give it some flavor.\nYou can also pour a glass of water ( approx 300ml) and add pinch of salt, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of sugar for a tart, yet sweet, drink.\n\n, Ginger helps to combat Hyperemesis gravidarum. It increases the movement of the gastrointestinal symptom and stops the signals to the brain that are responsible for making you feel like vomiting., This drink provides you with nutrients to keep you healthy. The recipe can be altered if some aspect of the flavor or texture is not to your liking. In a blender, combine:\n\n\nOne cup of fresh apple juice, 1 frozen banana, 1 teaspoon of blackstrap molasses, 1 glass of yoghurt, 2 teaspoonfuls of nutritional yeast, 1 tablespoon of protein powder, 1-2 tablespoons of honey, 1 glass of low fat milk, 1 teaspoon of kelp that contains a mixture of minerals, and 3 tablespoons of nuts., You can take vitamin B6 supplements to potentially decrease your chances of vomiting.Again, it is always best to talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.The normal recommended dose is 50 mg a day.\n\n, Talking to a doctor or specialist is always recommended before trying a new herb or making drastic changes to your diet. Wild yam root is thought to affect your estrogen levels and decrease the likelihood that you will feel nauseous. The root contains steroidal saponins that can affect your hormones.The dried herb generally comes in 2 to 4 gram capsules that can be taken daily with one cup of water.\n\n",

The slipping motion\nlasted about 40 min and the flux rope started to rise up slowly at the late\nstage of the slippage. Then an X2.1 flare was initiated and the flux rope was\nimpulsively accelerated. One of the flare ribbons swept across a\nnegative-polarity sunspot and the penumbral segments of the sunspot decayed\nrapidly after the flare. We studied the magnetic topology at the flaring region\nand the results showed the existence of a twisted flux rope, together with\nquasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) structures binding the flux rope. Our\nobservations imply that quasi-periodic slipping magnetic reconnection occurs\nalong the flux-rope-related QSLs in the preflare stage, which drives the later\neruption of the flux rope and the associated flare.\n",

        "text":"The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), or simply Neighbor Discovery (ND), is a protocol of the Internet protocol suite used with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6).  It operates at the link layer of the Internet model, and is responsible for gathering various information required for network communication, including the configuration of local connections and the domain name servers and gateways.\n\nThe protocol defines five ICMPv6 packet types to perform functions for IPv6 similar to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Router Discovery and Router Redirect protocols for IPv4. It provides many improvements over its IPv4 counterparts (RFC 4861, section 3.1). For example, it includes Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD), thus improving robustness of packet delivery in the presence of failing routers or links, or mobile nodes.\n\nThe Inverse Neighbor Discovery (IND) protocol extension (RFC 3122) allows nodes to determine and advertise an IPv6 address corresponding to a given link-layer address, similar to Reverse ARP for IPv4.\n\nThe Secure Neighbor Discovery Protocol (SEND), a security extension of NDP, uses Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) and the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to provide an alternative mechanism for securing NDP with a cryptographic method that is independent of IPsec. Neighbor Discovery Proxy (ND Proxy) (RFC 4389) provides a service similar to IPv4 Proxy ARP and allows bridging multiple network segments within a single subnet prefix when bridging cannot be done at the link layer.\n\nFunctions\nNDP defines five ICMPv6 packet types for the purpose of router solicitation, router advertisement, neighbor solicitation, neighbor advertisement, and network redirects.\n\nRouter Solicitation (Type 133) Hosts inquire with Router Solicitation messages to locate routers on an attached link. Routers which forward packets not addressed to them generate Router Advertisements immediately upon receipt of this message rather than at their next scheduled time.\nRouter Advertisement (Type 134) Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a Router Solicitation message.\nNeighbor Solicitation (Type 135) Neighbor solicitations are used by nodes to determine the link-layer address of a neighbor, or to verify that a neighbor is still reachable via a cached link-layer address.\nNeighbor Advertisement (Type 136) Neighbor advertisements are used by nodes to respond to a Neighbor Solicitation message, or unsolicited to provide new information quickly.\nRedirect (Type 137) Routers may inform hosts of a better first-hop router for a destination.\n\nThese messages are used to provide the following functionality:\n Router discovery: hosts can locate routers residing on attached links.\n Prefix discovery: hosts can discover address prefixes that are on-link for attached links.\n Parameter discovery: hosts can find link parameters (e.g., MTU).\n Address autoconfiguration: optional stateless configuration of addresses of network interfaces (see  and ).\n Address resolution: mapping between IP addresses and link-layer addresses.\n Next-hop determination: hosts can find next-hop routers for a destination.\n Neighbor unreachability detection (NUD): determine that a neighbor is no longer reachable on the link.\n Duplicate address detection (DAD): nodes can check whether an address is already in use.\n Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) and DNS Search List (DNSSL) assignment via a router advertisement (RA) options. This is a proposed standard since 2010 and updated in March 2017, but not supported by all clients.\n Packet redirection to provide a better next-hop route for certain destinations.\n\nIANA maintains a list of all current NDP options as they are published.\n\nMessages formats\n\nSee also\n NDPMon Neighbor Discovery Protocol Monitor\n radvd (Router Advertisement Daemon)\n Secure Neighbor Discovery\n\nReferences\n\nInternet protocols\nInternet Standards\nIPv6\nLink protocols",

        "text":" Plan to have family worship, sing spiritual songs and have quiet time with Christ together, worshiping God and developing your walk in Christ. Be sure to study the Bible and to praise God for your opportunities and for giving you your very life. Have a personal relationship with Jesus. Anything that goes wrong pray to Him and lean not on your own understanding. Proverbs 3:5;\n, is based upon loving \"Jesus\", \"Others\" and then lastly, \"Yourself\"-\"but not least,\" as the Bible says you are \"to love others 'as you love yourself'.\" So love yourself as much as you love others and then you have the winning concept straight from Christ! This, for example, also means do not try to directly control your husband or other people (try gentle persuasion). J.O.Y. also means that you should not judge wrongly or harshly, but you will forgive yourself and others.\n\n, The Bible says: \"Stay in a habit of attending church regularly\" with your husband or alone (or with girlfriends), if necessary. \"Pray for each other.\" Pray together and \"pray without ceasing\" and \"honor Christ in all you do and say\"... Our physical lives are in Christ and spiritually \"His life on this earth is in us and we are in Him.\" He is \"at the right hand of the Father in Heaven where He is always interceding for us.\" (Romans 8:34)\n\n, Criticizing and putting yourself down to your husband or in front of him in public is a way of insulting his taste in women. Realize that if he is with you, it's because he chose you and wants to be with you. He finds you sexy enough, even if you don't feel like you are; so be there for him. Remember that attitude and willingness are important parts of feeling and being sexy. Poor self-esteem leaves a hole in your life that is terrible for your marriage. Make sure you continue to actually have occasional fun and help each other have an interesting life together, not just trying to control each other or only teasing about fun. Tease nicely, and mean it. Have a sense of humor.\n\n, Will you still have girlfriends you see at least once a week, your special church group that you go to, full days and busy evenings? If you were not whole, your husband would always have to be trying to fill a hole in your life. Well, it's one that he won't ever fill, and you might both feel inadequate and unhappy, if you can't keep yourself up with friends and family as well as busy cheerfully serving Christ.\n\n, Except in case your husband reads minds, don't expect your husband to just know what you want. If you want or need something, ask and discuss it together. Don't just drop hints and figure that he'll get it and \"come around\" without communicating calmly, clearly and directly. If something is wrong for you, say so. Christian friendships and relationships work best when each partner calmly expresses their current emotion -- without harping on what the other did. Frequently, a \"I feel confused\", or \"I feel sad\" is all it takes for him to step back and ask, \"Why?\" Then simply say, \"When you slammed the door, I felt ignored (or insulted).\" Let \"I feel...\" be your key word. Avoid saying \"you\"--as in \"you made me sad.\" Say \"'That' made me feel sad.\" Take responsibility for your own needs and feelings.\n\n, He needs to keep trying to do well, and you need to keep trying also, but neither of you will ever be perfect. Unsatisfied expectations frustrate everyone. However, if you both continue to work on your marriage, you will always be involved in each others lives, even when one of you comes up a little short. If your expectations are truly too high, very idealistic or unrealistic, you should set standards that are obtainable. For example, it is unfair to expect to be lavished with possessions. Have the love of your life at home; staying home, try having home cooking at several meals per week versus going out to eat junk food instead.\n\n, Also, should you want more together time, be prepared to have that desire fulfilled with some effort, washing clothes and cleaning house together and relaxing together.\n\n, Nagging and nitpicking can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes get clean and are unbroken, for instance: don't nag about how you want the dishwasher loaded--the \"the right way\". Let him do such things his own way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what is more important and don't be a complainer. Maybe explain the theory as you show him how you believe it needs to be done one time and then leave it alone.\"Wives, place yourselves under your husbands' authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord's authority.\"(Ephesians 5:22) but only so far as he is not doing crimes, is not cruel or actually abusive (not the blame game...) to you, the children or other persons.\n\n, (Ephesians 5:25) If your husband is not showing love, do not demand attention or affection. Just ask cheerfully for some help and pick a time to give a playful or sexy hug and kiss: he may respond well, if he's not angry--or unless it is not the right place and time.\n\n, This affection and fun will carry over to when you have the chance and the time in private.\n\n, Be willing to try some innocent, new things (or even suggest\/approach it affectionately without asking) and discuss them - don't just turn down fun and harmless play when he suggests something you don't feel is appealing immediately. This may make him feel rejected or that you are not having fun. At least be willing to discuss it nicely, and perhaps try it, but never do anything you are uncomfortable with after discussing it with him. Also, don't be afraid to discuss anything you might be interested in. Physical intimacy is as important to a marriage as is \"emotional intimacy\". Nurture them both.\"Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\" (1 Corinthians 7:5)\n\n, Accept him as he is, so that you have such deep respect and gratitude for him that you would never want him to change for you. He has so much to offer you, if you give him the space to be himself. He is a growing individual, just like you are. Help him grow in the direction that he chooses, and give him the chance to help you similarly.\n\n, \"And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with vanity about her hair and gold or jewels or expensive clothing;\" (1 Timothy 2:9) Encourage your husband to expect you to be modest in public and erotic in private with him. There is much temptation that results from women feeling as if they need to turn other men on and to show their sensual side in public. One thing may lead to another. Avoid immodesty.\n\n, Your spouse is not perfect and he will at times upset you, or even hurt your feelings. When this happens you have a choice to make; you either harbor offense and let your heart become hardened, or you can remember how patient and forgiving God is with you and forgive your husband just as you have been forgiven by The Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick to repent. Just as your husband is not perfect neither are you. The Bible says that \"God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble\" (James 4:6) It is so important in your relationship with your husband and with God that you be willing to humble yourself and ask for forgiveness when you are wrong, or have acted in an unloving way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick to believe. 1 Corinthians 13:7 says, \"it (love) always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Don't simply focus on the bad about your husband, but see him the way God sees him; focus on the attributes that you love about him and always believe and compliment him, such as: \"Honey, God is working in your heart, and so you are becoming more like Christ everyday.\" The trick is to believe this even when it doesn't look like it! That is real faith in action, believing God can bring it to reality even when you don't see it.\n\n",

        "text":"School can be a dull experience for most children, but nonetheless, is an important part of early life. Technology has made its way into the school system, and presented a unique opportunity for students: online classes. While virtual courses may seem ideal due to the added ability to study from home, online schooling would be detrimental to the youth. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home  because they would be less productive,  less social, less prepared for normal life than if they attended school in person.  The addition of online courses to a school's curriculum, while it might gain support from students, will inevitably decrease the productivity of the student population  Taking courses from home would allow too many distractions during the students' critical learning period. This drop in productivity will result from the many electronic devices found in modern homes, as well as the loss of common school rules such as limited lunch times and permission to use the restroom. While the rules may seem strict, they are put in place to keep students focused. The loss of a teacher's presence accompanies the loss of a physical classroom. Teachers are the main source of discipline for schools, as they are constantly monitoring their students, and encouraging productiveness, and their lack of authority due to online courses will be detrimental to the student's education. Online classes require children to be self motivated, a characteristic hard to find in today's youth.  Because of the ability to stay home while attending school, online courses will decrease the social aspect of students' lives. Public school creates a distinct social environment due to a diverse group of people. Required attendance to school allows for children to interact with their peers and create friendships, whereas virtual classes would remove the physical factor and make connections harder to create. While online courses remove rigid schedules, they also remove the necessity to relax and unwind from stress. This necessary relaxation drives people to meet up with their peers and enjoy each other's presence, a tradition that will see a drastic decrease among children if online courses are implemented. The removal of a standard schedule also creates differentiation in availability throughout friend groups, causing difficulties when planning events. Virtual courses remove mandatory attendance to school, and thusly remove children's primary opportunity to create relationships.  The convenience of online courses will create false expectations of life after school for young adults, and will subsequently leave them unprepared for their experiences in society. The ability to work whenever one desires is not a trait that will follow into a common workplace, and the strict rules and schedule of public school are designed for the exact purpose of prepping children for their lives after youth. Online courses will remove the set schedule and the tried and true method of training for workplace skills and etiquette. Also detrimental to the abilities of a productive member of society is mindset that the education system will change its methods of teaching in order to serve the individual. Careers and occupations will never change their methods to make things more convenient to one singular employee, and by granting children the convenience to stay home and study whenever they choose, schools will ultimately set them up for failure in society. \nWhile online courses can be seen in a positive light, as they create a convenient, stress free environment for learning, they are dangerous to the development of the youth. Virtual classes will result in lowered productivity, sociability, and preparation for the workplace due to their ability to let students study from home. Convenience and a lack of stress are unrealistic expectations in an ever busy society, and the education system should not allow themselves to give students false ideas about life after school. ",

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" I do not thing think this is the best method of voting on the next President for our Country.  I feel this way because the people of America do not really make the decision of who becomes President their vote just goes to a slate of electors. People may say that the Electoral College is fair  but some of the biggest states only vote on democratic or republican canidates and thats not fair at all.\n The first reason I think the Electoral college should be abolished is because the deciding factor of who becomes Americas President doesn't come from the people it comes from the Electoral college.  Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for the President but for a slate of electors. The election process should be changed to \"election by popular vote.\"  Another reason I think we shouldn't use the electoral college is because some states are biased towards certain political groups so say California wanted a democrat to be President that person would recieve 55 electoral votes from just one state! Many states that don't have as many electoral votes may not even get to see the canidates because they only care about the larger states. For instance, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.  The third reason I think we should let the outcome be decided by the American people and not electoral colleges is because the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California.  In conclusion, I think that the Electoral College should be abloished because the deciding factor for who becomes President comes from the electoral college, states can be biased towards certain political groups, and because its just simply unfair, outdated, and irrational just like Bob Dole said!

Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting\nscenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other\nnations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can\nindependently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service.\nIn this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is\nessential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to\ndesign effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease.

How memories are preserved for months or years, despite\nmolecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronal\nactivity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to\npreferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis\nhas not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing\nbiochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into\ntwo such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential\nbiochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model\nrepresents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed\nmodel adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled\nas continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of\nsynaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the\namplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or\ntheta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high\nweight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parameter\nvariations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity reset\nsynapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,\nepisodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.\nBoth models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions are\nexpected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled to\nmaintenance of synaptic strength.\n",

Practice juggling for 1 hour every day for about a month, most likely you are going to be an expert in juggling and you are able to do 100 keep-ups no sweat (if you practice).\n\n, This move is a basic freestyle trick that leads up to other tricks. Once you master this trick you can work up to harder better tricks.\n\n, This is not as easy as it sounds. For this trick you need a lot of speed and again a lot of patience. You should begin with the motion of it, and try doing it as fast as possible. When you think you are ready, out a ball in the play. Again practice for an hour a day for about 2 months and you can master this. But this trick is a lot harder than juggling so you need more patience. (*You can do this trick from juggling or from a stall, in both cases you should start going around the ball right after you flick it up, for juggling ATW, you should hit the ball from the right side of your foot for right legged people, and from the left side of your foot for left legged people.)\n\n, Similar to foot stall you balance it on your neck. You can do this trick from a foot stall, you flick it up this time about half a meter higher than your head. Then you cushion the ball on your neck keeping you back straight on a 90 degree angle and keep your arm pointing back keeping your elbows straight. The key move in this trick is to cushion the ball on your neck, meaning you take the power of the ball away by going down at the same time as the ball only a bit slower than it so the power can be absorbed to your back\/neck. Practice this trick for about half an hour every day for 2 weeks and you can perfect it. This trick is much easier than ATW.\n\n, For example you can begin by juggling then going to a foot stall, then do ATW, followed by another foot stall and then a neck stall. If you are able to do all these three moves and keep the ball off the ground, you are going to be given respect.\n\n",

        "text":"General Steven Rockwell Trevor is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Wonder Woman. The character was created by William Moulton Marston and first appeared in All Star Comics #8 (October 21, 1941). Steve Trevor is a trusted friend, love interest, and partner of Wonder Woman who introduced her to \"Man's World\", and has served as her United Nations liaison. He is the first foreigner to have ever set foot on Themyscira and the first ambassador to open diplomatic relations with the Amazons.\n\nThe character has appeared in various adaptations of the comics. He has been voiced by actors such as Tahmoh Penikett, Nathan Fillion, and George Newbern, among others in various Wonder Woman and Justice League productions. Lyle Waggoner portrayed the character in the 1970s Wonder Woman series, while Chris Pine portrayed him in the DC Extended Universe films Wonder Woman (2017) and Wonder Woman 1984 (2020).\n\nPublication history\nSteve Trevor first appeared in All Star Comics #8 (December 1941).\n\nPre-Crisis\nSteve Trevor was originally introduced as an intelligence operative and officer in the United States Army Air Corps who became stranded on Wonder Woman's homeland where he was a herald to the Amazons that World War II was occurring in \"Man's World\". He also developed a close relationship with the heroine. Though a military man with experience in the field, storylines involving post-Marston Steve and Wonder Woman also involved Wonder Woman coming to Steve's rescue, as well as vice versa.\n\nThe character was killed off in Wonder Woman #180 (January - February 1969), shot by the henchmen of Doctor Cyber. In a WW letter column in issue #195, artist Mike Sekowsky explained, \"Steve Trevor was dull and boring and I didn't like him much, so I disposed of him.\" The character was later resurrected by another creative team.\n\nSteve's visibility in comics varied through the 1970s to the 1990s, with his character either absent or sidelined in favour of fantasy and action-adventure Wonder Woman stories without romantic interests.\n\nPost-Crisis\nIn more recent portrayals, and particularly since DC's 2011 reboot, Steve is portrayed as a senior government agent and super spy whose close connection to Wonder Woman makes him the United States' liaison to the Justice League. In 2013, in his capacity as a skilled government agent, Steve himself became the member of a new incarnation of the Justice League of America.\n\nCharacterization\n\nPersonality\nThe character was designed to be a complement to Wonder Woman's character.  Chris Pine described Trevor as a \"rogue-ish, cynical realist who's seen the awful brutish nature of modern civilization\" and added he is a \"worldly guy, a charming guy\". Steve Trevor gave Diana the nickname, \"Angel\", because having been delirious from his injuries, Themyscira seemed heaven-like with her being the \"angel\" that saved him. Throughout his comic book appearances Steve is often shown to have a strong moral compass and has been depicted as jaded and even insubordinate towards his superior officers if he deems their decisions to be unethical. \n\nSteve Trevor is the first foreigner to have ever set foot on Themyscira, the first man Diana has ever seen, and the first ambassador to open diplomatic relations with the Amazons. Trevor, Superman and Batman are the only men in the DC Universe to be granted honorary citizenship by  Queen Hippolyta; an extraordinary feat, given that Aphrodite's Law demands the death penalty for any man who sets foot on Themyscira. He was often Diana's primary love interest and their relationship was usually a flirtatious one, yet they always remained steadfast friends. On occasion, Marston would place Trevor in \"gentleman-in-jeopardy\" situations as an appropriate male version of the damsel in distress trope. His marriage proposals were often rejected, as Diana prioritized saving the world first before marriage, in accordance with Aphrodite's Law. In more recent years Steve and Diana's relationships in the comics have become more platonic, or at times either of their love is unrequited.\n\nFictional character biography\n\n20th century\n\nGolden Age\nIn the original version of Wonder Woman's origin story, Steve Trevor was an intelligence officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II whose plane crashed on Paradise Island, the isolated homeland of the Amazons. He was nursed back to health by the Amazon princess Diana, who fell in love with him and accompanied him when he returned to the outside world. There she became Wonder Woman (and also his coworker, Diana Prince).\n\nSteve Trevor was portrayed as a blonde military hero who often fought battles both alone and alongside Wonder Woman. At the same time, he was also a traditional superhero's love interest and gentleman-in-jeopardy: getting kidnapped and being rescued from peril by Wonder Woman, as well as pining after the superheroine in the red-and-blue outfit while failing to notice her resemblance to his meek, bespectacled secretary Diana Prince. Although, at times, Steve has rescued Wonder Woman.\nThe character was purposely made blond, which stemmed from William Moulton Marston’s belief that the best romantic combination is a blue-eyed brunette girl to a light-haired man, because blond males are more submissive to brunette females, according to him.\n\nSilver and Bronze Age\nAfter Marston's death, much of the original supporting cast paid less attention to him. Under writer-editor Robert Kanigher, both his and Diana's personalities were compromised considerably, with Steve beginning to seem threatened by his heroine's power, and Diana almost beginning to seem apologetic about it.\n\nDuring the '50s and '60s, comic writers regularly made Wonder Woman lovesick over Steve Trevor, here a Major in the United States Army. Stories frequently featured Wonder Woman hoping or imagining what it would be like to marry Steve Trevor. As with Superman stories of the same period, the question of marriage was never far from the couple's minds. There was also considerable attention given to the threat of the Amazon's secret identity being revealed.\n\nWonder Woman often found herself agreeing to Steve's contests for her hand in marriage, which he typically cheated at using government tracking equipment. Afraid that she loved someone else; Steve once again misused government spying equipment to stalk Wonder Woman, finding her with her childhood boyfriend Mer-Man; whom he felt the need to prove himself better than.\n\nIn 1968, Diana chose to give up her powers and cut ties with her native Paradise Island to stay close to Steve. Trevor was killed off in the next issue. He was thus absent for the next few years of the comic. In the mid-1970s, following the return of the heroine's powers, Trevor was brought back to life by Aphrodite, and given a new identity as the brunette Steve Howard. In 1978, he was killed off again. He would be replaced in 1980 by a double from another, undisclosed dimension of the Multiverse. For the next few years the classic relationship of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor would be essentially restored, and explored with some detail. In 1985 with issue #322, writer Dan Mishkin dealt with Trevor's three separate \"lives\", and after much explanation merged the \"new\" Steve with the old.\n\nDuring this same period in early 1980s issues of Wonder Woman, the villainous Doctor Psycho fused Steve's image with Wonder Woman's abilities and became \"Captain Wonder\", sporting a costume similar to Wonder Woman's. In the final issue of the original Wonder Woman series, Steve and Diana get married.\n\nModern Age\nThe 1985 comic book storyline \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" retconned, or rebooted the fictional continuity of the DC Universe. At the end of the storyline, the Wonder Woman and retired four-star General Steve Trevor of pre-Crisis Earth-Two traveled to Mount Olympus to live with the Greek gods and goddesses, as many of the other pre-Crisis Earth-Two heroes died or merged into a new streamlined continuity. The Wonder Woman of pre-Crisis Earth-One was devolved back into the mystical clay from which she was formed (technically dying), thus allowing Wonder Woman and her supporting characters to be re-introduced with new origins, backgrounds and plotlines.\n\nWith the restart of the series in the second volume after \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Steve Trevor was revamped to be considerably older than Diana. In addition, the two of them never had a romantic relationship. Years before Trevor's crash landing on Themyscira (the modern name for Paradise Island), his lost mother, Diana Rockwell Trevor, a pilot for the Women Airforce Service Pilots, had also crashed there, finding the Amazons battling a large monster. Seeing they were close to defeat, Diana Trevor used her pistol on the beast, giving the Amazons an advantage in the battle. Trevor dies as a result. After her death the Amazons considered the outworlder to be an honored hero for her sacrifice. It is from her that Queen Hippolyta named her daughter Diana and also from her that the Amazons came into possession of a gun originating from Man's World. It is this familial link that led the god Ares to manipulate Steve into bombing Themyscira to eliminate the Amazons. However while in flight and guided to the island, Trevor realized he was about to needlessly bomb civilians and attempted to abort the mission. Steve's co-pilot, a minion of the war-god, transforms into a monster in an attempt to continue the attack. Diana rescues Steve from the resulting disaster.\n\nBringing the unconscious Trevor to the island, Diana recognized his American flag insignia on his uniform mirrored her own armor's color motif and took this as a sign of where she had to go to begin her fight against Ares. Thus inspired, Diana took Trevor to 'Man's World' in the city of Boston and began her calling. Since then, Trevor and Diana have been close friends despite him being old enough to be her father. This version of Steve Trevor went on to marry Etta Candy and became the Deputy Secretary of Defense for the U.S. government.\n\n21st century\n\n\"Infinite Crisis\"\nFollowing the 2005–2006 \"Infinite Crisis\" storyline, Wonder Woman's origin was yet again revamped, as was her supporting cast. Diana is no longer a recent arrival to man's world, but instead has lived in it for some time, having been involved in the creation of the Justice League of America (as was the case in the group's Silver Age introductory story in 1960). Although Steve Trevor still remains close friends with Diana and married to Etta, his history with Diana has not fully been developed.\n\nThe New 52\nIn the aftermath of the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" storyline, DC Comics cancelled all of their monthly books and relaunched them with a rebooted continuity, in an initiative called The New 52. In this continuity, Steve Trevor is a long-time advocate for the Amazons, having lobbied the U.S. government for peace with the Amazons, arguing that they are benevolent. Steve then becomes Wonder Woman's U.N. liaison during her stay in Washington, D.C. and later becomes the head of the newly formed A.R.G.U.S., (Advanced Research Group for Uniting Super-Humans), as well as the UN's liaison to the newly formed Justice League. Promoted to the rank of Colonel, his assistant is Etta Candy and he has made his feelings and attraction to Wonder Woman clear to her, although his feelings were not reciprocated. The hero Black Orchid is revealed to be A.R.G.U.S. Agent Alba Garcia, working covertly for Justice League Dark to monitor John Constantine.\n\nTrevor is also a member of several team books, including Team 7, which launched in September 2012, and Justice League of America, launched in 2013.\n\nThe pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" version of Trevor seen in the 2015 \"Convergence\" storyline works with Diana and Etta Candy to better the fate of Earth One's Gotham City while stuck under an alien dome for a year. When vampiric versions of Gotham criminals from Earth-43 invade a makeshift church service, it is up to Diana and Steve to keep them from spilling out into the streets. Steve falls prey to the vampires, arising as one of them. However, he manages to maintain his own free will, taking down a vampire and falling under the rubble of the collapsing church.\n\nDC Rebirth\nAs part of DC Comics' 2016 relaunch of its monthly titles and their continuity, DC Rebirth, Wonder Woman's origin is retold in the \"Year One\" storyline. Steve crashes on the island of Themyscira and is the sole survivor. He is saved and nursed back to health by the Amazons, and a competition is held to determine the one to take Steve and the bodies of his fallen comrades back to America, one that Diana wins. In the United States, Trevor relates to the authorities his experiences with the Amazons and Diana, and the two become allies in subsequent conflicts with terrorists, the Greek god of war Ares, a global virus, an African cult, a paramilitary group called Poison, and the supervillain group Godwatch.\n\nOther versions\n\nJustice\nThe Silver Age Steve Trevor makes an appearance in Alex Ross' 2005–2007 miniseries Justice. He is among the sidekicks and loved ones attacked by the Legion of Doom, and can be seen embracing Wonder Woman.\n\nWonder Woman: Amazonia\nIn the Elseworlds story Wonder Woman: Amazonia, Stephen Trevor is a Royal Marine who tricks the Amazons into being loyal, but then calls down the British Empire and slaughters them all except Diana. He brings her to Man's World to put her into stage plays re-enacting Biblical stories. Diana later kills Stephen as revenge.\n\nAmalgam\nIn the alternate universe depicted in Amalgam Comics, Steve Trevor is fused with The Punisher\/Frank Castle to form Trevor Castiglione\/Trevor Castle. A seasoned combat veteran who went AWOL after his wife and children were caught in a Mafia ceasefire and were killed, Castle decided to begin a one-man war on crime. After being wounded in a gunfight, he was saved by rogue Amazon princess Diana Prince (who left Themyscira by herself without becoming Wonder Woman in this world, the title being given to this universe's version of Storm instead), leading the two to start a romantic relationship that led to marriage and the birth of their son Ryan. However the two eventually separated over their differences until Ryan was kidnapped, forcing the two to work together. After learning that Thanoseid (an amalgam of Thanos and Darkseid) was responsible, they tried to get Ryan back only to fail when he seemingly killed their child. However, in reality Thanoseid had only sent their son back in time to become his personal assassin Kanto, which Diana figured out and revealed. Thanoseid, who had wanted revenge for the death of his son Orion and had hoped Castle or Kanto would die at the hands of the other, sent everyone back where they belong. Castle and Diana then decided to get back together.\n\nFlashpoint\nIn the alternate timeline of the 2011 \"Flashpoint\" storyline, Steve and Wonder Woman have no relationship; instead, it appears that he is in love with Lois Lane. Steve made an appearance in London where he is waiting at a rendezvous point for Lois Lane as he is attacked by Wonder Woman and the Amazons. Wonder Woman catches him by the neck with her Lasso of Truth and begins interrogating him after he is temporarily able to resist the lasso's effects. He explains that he was hired to extract Lois Lane from New Themyscira because she was sent to gather information on the Amazons for Cyborg who's amassing superhumans to stop the fighting between Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Steve's fate comes to an end when Wonder Woman strangles him to death.\n\nWonder Woman: Earth One\nSteve Trevor appears in the 2016 original graphic novel Wonder Woman: Earth One in a similar manner to his original counterpart, though this time presented as African-American.\n\nThe Legend of Wonder Woman\nSteve Trevor appears as a major supporting character in the Legend of Wonder Woman, an alternate re-telling of Wonder Woman's origin that debuted in 2016 by writer Greg Rucka. Similar to Marston's original comics, the young pilot Steve Trevor crash lands on Paradise Island.\n\nIn other media\n\nTelevision\n\nLive-action\n\n Steve Trevor appears in Wonder Woman (1974), portrayed by Kaz Garas.\n Steve Trevor Sr. and Jr. appear in Wonder Woman (1975), both portrayed by Lyle Waggoner.

After stealing information on a deadlier form of mustard gas being developed by Dr. Isabel Maru on General Erich Ludendorff's behalf, Trevor crashes his plane on Themyscira, where Diana Prince learns of the war he is involved in and leaves with him to end it. As Trevor guides her into the world outside of Themyscira and how mankind functions, they grow closer despite conflicts over how to stop the war, with him focusing on stopping Maru while she wants to kill Ares. Ultimately, Trevor tells Prince that he loves her and leaves her his father's watch as a keepsake before hijacking a German strategic bomber containing the gas and sacrificing himself to incinerate it at a safe distance. This act leads to Prince believing the world can only be saved through love, not hatred.\n In Wonder Woman 1984, Prince comes into contact with the Dreamstone and unknowingly wishes for Trevor to come back to life, causing his soul to manifest in the body of an unnamed man (portrayed by Kristoffer Polaha), with Prince recognizing him as the former while everyone else sees the latter. While guiding him through the 1980s, among other changes since WWI, they work together to find out more about the Dreamstone and stop Maxwell Lord, who acquired the Dreamstone's powers and is unknowingly causing global chaos, as well as Barbara Ann Minerva, Prince's friend who became more violent after making her own wish with the Dreamstone.

        "text":"Our society's reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.\n\nMobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver's. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence. Using cell phones at all while driving should absolutely not be allowed. Any amount of attention diverted from the road is incredibly dangerous. \nSome of the most fatal accidents have occured, not because of intoxication, but as a result of texting and driving. In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren't for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving.  Even the best drivers may be involved in a potentially life-threatening crash while trying to use their phone and drive  According to an NPR article on multitasking, when you are \"Switching from task to task, you think you're actually paying attention to everything around you at the same time. But you're actually not  You're not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly\"  The article later goes on to state, \"You cannot focus on one while doing the other. That's because of what's called interference between the two tasks.\" Based off of this information, it can be inferred the concept of interference is also applicable to using a smartphone while driving. If a driver is busy paying attention to their screen, there is no way they could also be paying close attention to the road.  Even five seconds of being distracted by a cell phone can be enough time for someone to get into an accident  One personal injury lawyer states, \"A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field\" (Miller & Zois). A range this large in a such a short time span conveys how much potential there is for injury when behaving so carelessly. Anyone who may claim it is safe for them to go on their phone while operating a vehicle because they are a master at multitasking is simply overconfident in their abilities. The truth is, it would be impossible for anyone to drive safely while distracted.\n\nWith lives at risk, texting and driving should be out of the question. Not only would such negligence put one's own physical well being at risk, but all those around them as well.  Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.\n",

        "text":"Summer projects are immensely helpful in order to keep your mind active and intelligent when your're not in school, constantly stimulated by academic subjects.  the summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher designed.  Students making the projects know what will help their peers learn throughout the summer, they know what they have truly learned rather than what teachers assumed they have been taught by other teachers,  they have the opportunity to showcase their creativity and passions through the project they complete. In order to be most successful, students should have authority to be creative and responsible for their summer projects.  Summer projects purpose is to continue the growth of your mind when you are out of the classroom for about 90 days. A lot can happen to adolescents over the summer, a lot of things that anyone who is not in the same phase of life can truly understand. Many teenagers find sanity with their peers and friends in this time frame of growing up. As seen and extensively studied by Erik Erikson, Erikson came to the consensus that when you are going through the school-age stage of life you begin to pull away from your parents and adults to find yourself and find your independence. In result, you grow more drawn to your friends and peers, due to them understanding the phase of development you are going through. The connection students have with each other is something that can not be matched by teachers. No matter the background or clique a student is in they all have one major characteristic in common that connects them, they are all students. Teachers have not been in school in years and they don't connect with the same things as this generation does. Teachers did not have the same technology, pop culture, or even the same societal standards as today students have. Throughout my school years, I find myself stressed and concerned every year when I receive a new teacher, after a long and carefree summer. The teachers have so much faith in their coworkers and the retention of the knowledge that according to them \"we should have learned in years past.\" They begin to assign \"easy\" and \"refresher\" work that they assume we have been taught. The lack of communication between teachers is a hard burden on students due to their past teachers exclaiming that \"you do not need to worry about that, your teacher next year will teach you,\" and your present teachers thinking that you had already learned it in your past courses. As the student, you are left with the sense of delusion and dissatisfaction on why you lack this important skill and learning target. You struggle to understand basic fundamentals of learning and when you are assigned a project you begin to sweat the little gaps in your learning. Every student knows this feeling of remorse of being assigned a project on material you just havent been taught yet. Students who design the projects know what they and their peers have been taught and what they all lack because they have all endured the same classes and teachers. The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experience and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before.  The teachers teach every student the same in order to maintain a consistency and basis of learning. By doing this they lose the chance to see the passions and talents of the individual students. Consistent learning is needed but teachers lack the understanding that every student is different and have their own learning process and strengths. Modern day students recognize the differences throughout their peers and themselves. They notice that the differences unite them and it is ordinary to be different. Students who create the projects will implement the material to be expressive of their peers because they have the same mindset that comes with being in generation of identity and self-expression. Teachers do not see this aspect of learning they see learning targets and standards.  Student-designed projects would implement effective, continual learning over the summer break due to the students connection with their peers, knowledge of common learning gaps, and the generational need of creativity and self-expression. The purpose is to continue learning while not being in a classroom, but how can we continue to grow our knowledge if the students can not establish a connection with project due to being out-of-touch with modern day and the mentality of today' students. Therefore, in order to achieve maximum learning, students should be tasked with the project design. ",

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years, different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution  For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their \"goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.\" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to \"clear the air of the global city.\" This is due to \"days of near-record pollution.\" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution. it makes people happier.

        "text":"This is an interesting paper that investigates alternative neural machine translation approaches. Falling back to traditional concepts machine translation while using powerful neural models is essential to understanding the leap achieved by neural machine translation over conventional methods.\n\nIn terms of related work, there is a close relation to the paper Alignment-Based Neural Machine Translation (Alkhouli et al. 2016)*, whether in the decomposition of the model into neural alignment and  lexical\/word probabilities, or using a weighted log-linear combination to combine the models which are eventually used in a standalone decoder. A notable difference is that the paper uses direct translation models (as opposed to the inverted ones proposed by the authors here), and the fact that the models are trained on word-aligned data which speeds up training. As for the alignment model, the former choses to model non-monotone source jumps whereas the current paper choses two classes (emit and shift) to model monotone alignments. In (Alkhouli et al. 2016), decoding is done using a beam search decoder that hypothesizes alignments and word translations\n\nAs for the MT experiments, did you try the model combination using larger data (i.e. >=100M tokens). How long did the current models take to train on the 184K sentence pairs you are using? It would also be interesting to see how much you gain\/lose if the models were to be trained using given word alignments (e.g. obtained using GIZA++). Training then should be faster.\n\n* ",

        "text":"- Strengths:\n\nAuthors generate a dataset of “rephrased” captions and are planning to make\nthis dataset publicly available.\n\nThe way authors approached DMC task has an advantage over VQA or caption\ngeneration in terms of metrics. It is easier and more straightforward to\nevaluate problem of choosing the best caption. Authors use accuracy metric.\nWhile for instance caption generation requires metrics like BLUE or Meteor\nwhich are limited in handling semantic similarity.\n\nAuthors propose an interesting approach to “rephrasing”, e.g. selecting\ndecoys. They draw decoys form image-caption dataset. E.g. decoys for a single\nimage come from captions for other images. These decoys however are similar to\neach other both in terms of surface (bleu score) and semantics (PV similarity).\nAuthors use lambda factor to decide on the balance between these two components\nof the similarity score. I think it would be interesting to employ these for\nparaphrasing.\n\nAuthors support their motivation for the task with evaluation results. They\nshow that a system trained with the focus on differentiating between similar\ncaptions performs better than a system that is trained to generate captions\nonly. These are, however, showing that system that is tuned for a particular\ntask performs better on this task.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n\n It is not clear why image caption task is not suitable for comprehension task\nand why author’s system is better for this. In order to argue that system can\ncomprehend image and sentence semantics better one should apply learned\nrepresentation, e.g. embeddings. E.g. apply representations learned by\ndifferent systems on the same task for comparison.\n\nMy main worry about the paper is that essentially authors converge to using\nexisting caption generation techniques, e.g. Bahdanau et al., Chen et al.\n\nThey way formula (4) is presented is a bit confusing. From formula it seems\nthat both decoy and true captions are employed for both loss terms. However, as\nit makes sense, authors mention that they do not use decoy for the second term.\nThat would hurt mode performance as model would learn to generate decoys as\nwell. The way it is written in the text is ambiguous, so I would make it more\nclear either in the formula itself or in the text. Otherwise it makes sense for\nthe model to learn to generate only true captions while learning to distinguish\nbetween true caption and a decoy.\n\n- General Discussion:\n\nAuthors formulate a task of Dual Machine Comprehension. They aim to accomplish\nthe task by challenging computer system to solve a problem of choosing between\ntwo very similar captions for a given image. Authors argue that a system that\nis able to solve this problem has to “understand” the image and captions\nbeyond just keywords but also capture semantics of captions and their alignment\nwith image semantics.\n\nI think paper need to make more focus on why chosen approach is better than\njust caption generation and why in their opinion caption generation is less\nchallenging for learning image and text representation and their alignment.\n\nFor formula (4). I wonder if in the future it is possible to make model to\nlearn “not to generate” decoys by adjusting second loss term to include\ndecoys but with a negative sign. Did authors try something similar?",

        "text":" See how the pants fit. Pay particular attention to how they feel in the different areas of the hips and legs. It may be that they're comfortable in the waist but too loose or snug in the thighs. Make a note of this: it will help you get the cut right later.;\n, Are you going for a more casual knee length, or a super-short summer fit? Decide how long or short you want the shorts to be. Plan on cutting the shorts at least a half inch longer than your desired length to allow for a hem, unless you want to leave the edges unfinished.Take a look at your favorite pair of shorts for reference when choosing a length.\nCut the shorts a little longer than desired on your first attempt and try them on. The dimensions of the shorts will look different when worn and they may come out looking right and ready to hem. You can always cut them shorter if you need to, but you can't add material back once it's gone.\n\n, Use a pencil or washable marker to mark where you intend to cut the pant legs. This will guide you while you cut for a cleaner finish, and any remaining marks will wash out later.Make a small dot where you want to cut the pant legs while you're wearing them, then mark them the rest of the way while the pants are lying flat so that the marks will be straight.\n\n, Scissors are the obvious choice and allow more manual control, but a box cutter can provide a straighter, more precise cut, and tearing will create a more rugged, distressed look.\n\n\nExercise caution when using any cutting tool, particularly the box cutter; these have extremely sharp exposed edges that make cutting a breeze, but can pose a danger to the user if not wielded safely.\n\n, Lay the pants flat and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. Use the scissors or box cutter to cut the pant leg. Follow the measuring marks you made carefully to ensure you get the right length.Once you've cut the first leg, place the removed portion over the second leg to make sure that they're both the same length.\nLonger strokes with the scissors work best to keep the edges from becoming choppy.\nIf you're using the box cutter, make sure you have a suitable cutting surface underneath the pants. Otherwise, the blade can scar surfaces when it slices through the fabric.\n\n, Alternatively, if you want your new shorts to have a rougher look, you can tear the pant legs by hand. Make a one- to two-inch incision with the scissors or box cutter to open a small hole and tear the leg the rest of the way. Place the pant leg across your lap and tear toward yourself slowly to keep the tear even; if you mess up, it can be difficult to salvage the tear.For a more even tear, you can make multiple smaller holes and \"connect the dots\" by tearing between them.\nIf you do happen to make a mistake while tearing, make a straight cut in the uneven part with the scissors and try again.\nTorn shorts with unfinished hems tend to look better when using rougher materials like denim, as the thread is coarse and tends to fray in a more visually appealing way. The tearing method can also work with especially old or worn pants to go along with the rugged look.\n\n, Try the shorts on. If they're too long, cut them again about half an inch at a time until they're the preferred length. Remove any loose threads, frayed edges or uneven nicks made by the scissors until the leg openings are clean and level.\n\n, Decide what length you'd like the hem to be and mark the shorts again. Shorter hems will produce a neater, more uniform look, while a longer hem will create the appearance of folds., Fold the hem under twice (or over, if you want the folded look) and use a sewing machine to stitch the hem at the proper length. You can also sew the hem by hand, if you prefer. Take care not to stitch the leg opening shut by mistake.If you don't have access to a sewing machine and want a completed hem for you shorts, take them to any alteration shop to have them stitched for a small price.\nPlace a rounded object in the leg opening and stitch around it to avoid sewing the leg opening shut.\n\n, You're finished! See how the new shorts look. If the hem is too long or too short, the stitching can be snipped and redone. Experiment with other lengths, hems and styles and add a fresh new dimension to your wardrobe.\n\n",

        "text":" Being a champion couch sitter and avid prime time TV watcher is not going to impress anyone. Seek out new experiences and, preferably, do things that other people do not normally do. Impressing someone requires doing something that makes an impression.\n\n.\n\nCare about what you do. If you try to achieve something you just could care less about, you are unlikely to succeed.\nBe prepared for hard work. You will need to choose something that you care about enough to stick through difficulty. And there will be tough times--if it were easy, everyone would do it.\nDo the right thing. Wanting to impress people is natural; we all want to stand out. But be sure what you are doing to impress others is not hurting yourself or other people. Trying to impress people with your shoplifting is a dangerous path, so is trying to impress others by taking reckless dares.\nAim high, but start small. Mastering a skill, or achieving a goal requires a number of steps to get there. Start with small, manageable changes to get there. Too big a leap and you might think what you are doing is impossible. For example, if you are trying to lose weight, start with cutting out soda and taking a 10 minute walk for a week.;\n, It is very easy to get overly self-centered, trying to impress others in order to feel good about yourself. And it is natural to want attention and feel important. However, you want to do so in a way that is healthy and positive.\n\nIt is OK to work hard to shine, but you are a worthy person just the way you are. Even if you never impress anyone with your artwork, that does not make you any less of a person.\nFind like-minded people. If you want to achieve something, it helps to have a community of people who have similar interests and goals. This is also a great way to build friendships.\nYou will not impress everyone all the time. Especially when starting out, you may not be impressive at all. And some people may not care what you do. That does not mean you will not succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Everyone is born with a set of gifts, and you can hone skills you already have with a little work. You can try new things and develop the skills you have always wanted to have.\n\nTalent only gets you so far. Yes, some people have phenomenal abilities that are seemingly effortless, such as child prodigies. However, without learning, persistence, interest, dedication, and optimism, talent is pretty useless.\nStop making excuses like \"I'm not that kind of person\" or \"I'm not talented enough to try ____\": just go out there and try.\nNo one is good at things on the first go and really interesting skills take time to learn but learning them at all will impress most people.\nA dumb or ridiculous talent can be a wonderful thing, if you handle it right.A funny trick is a great ice-breaker at parties, for example, even if it is good for little else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, drawing is a good example of a talent which some people naturally figure out. But it is a skill that can be taught and actually does not require any kind of innate temperament or skill.\n\nLearning to play the piano is also relatively easy and doesn’t take a lot of money to get started. Buy a cheap, used keyboard and start teaching yourself using our guide and some Youtube videos.\n\nTry learning origami. This is a relatively simple skill to start learning but it looks very impressive very quickly. It also means that you’ll always have a cheap gift to give someone in a pinch.\n\n, Stay up to date on the important news and political developments in order to be aware and ready to go when people start discussing those topics. You'll be able to chime in and join the conversation or even fill people in on aspects that they didn't know or understand.This will impress them.\n\n\nBeing well informed is useful because it doesn't require you to be super smart. Reading the newspaper and trying to understand politics doesn't require being a genius. But your knowledge and information can help other people make smart decisions in addition to putting you in a favorable light.\nJust remember to always be curious and skeptical. Always question everything. People make mistakes and it's possible that what you have read or believed in the past has since turned out to be wrong.\n\n, Of course, as you do all of these awesome things to impress people, you have to remember to be humble. Don’t brag or rub it in people’s faces that you do all these things. In fact, try not to tell them outright at all. Instead, let them see you doing these things in a normal way. This will make it seem more natural and also let you show off without looking like a jerk.\n\n\nFor example, when your friend invites you to a party, say something like, “I’ll try to make it but I usually volunteer at the church on Friday nights. I might have to be a bit late.”\nWhen you're going to meet them somewhere, show up early. Start doing an impressive activity like reading a classic novel or practicing guitar. They'll catch you \"in the act\" and be impressed. You don't even have to say anything.\n\n",

        "text":" A great exercise to include when you're experiencing PMS symptoms is walking. It's a low intensity exercise that you can do anywhere or anytime. In addition, walking feels like a more relaxing exercise instead of something more difficult or intense like running or a spin class.\n\n\nMany studies have shown that walking is a particularly good exercise for relieving PMS symptoms like cramping, bloating and depressed mood.Try going for a 30 minute moderate to brisk walk during the days leading up to and during your menstrual cycle.\nBetter yet, grab a good friend, your spouse or family member for your walk. Along with the aerobic aspect of walking, the social connection of being with a good friend can help alleviate a depressed or irritable mood.;\n, In addition to walking, yoga is another great form of exercise to do when you are experiencing PMS symptoms. Yoga is relaxing, is great for stress and can alleviate the aches and cramps associated with PMS.Some particularly good yoga poses to try include:\n\n\nSeated twist. This is an easy pose that can help massage your lower abdomen and work to relieve cramps. While sitting, cross one leg over the other placing your foot flat on the floor. Your crossed leg should be bent with your knee facing the ceiling. Twist your torso in the opposite direction of the bent leg. Hold this position for a few seconds and then switch sides.\nWind pose. This is another great pose to help relieve cramps and bloating. Lay flat on your back to start. Bring both of your legs up to your chest in a bent position. Wrap your arms around your shins and hold for a few seconds.\nChild's pose. This is a calming and de-stressing yoga pose. Kneel on the floor to start. Fold your upper body over your legs and allow your forehead to rest on the floor. Lay your arms on the floor behind you. Hold this position for a few moments.\n\n, You may not associate being in a bathing suit or swimming with a PMS exercise. However, being in the water is a great way to get in some exercise and also help relieve some PMS symptoms.Swimming, like walking or using the elliptical, is a low-impact exercise. You avoid the hard jumping or pounding associated with exercises like running or jumping.\nSwimming is also great for PMS because the water helps your body feel light and agile. Plus, the cooling sensation of the water can help you feel a little more relaxed and ease any aches or pains you may have with PMS symptoms.\nYou can try doing a few laps, do water walking or jogging or try out a water aerobics class. Aim to be moving or swimming for at least 30 minutes.\n\n, Very similar to yoga, there are some stretches and flexibility training exercises that can also help relieve symptoms of PMS. These exercises are particularly good for cramping, tension headaches or back and neck pain.Try doing a forward bend. This can be done anytime you feel your neck, shoulders or back tightening up. Stand with feet hip width apart and allow your torso to fold over so your head hangs towards the floor. Let your upper body relax and all your muscles go limp. Hold here and repeat as many times as needed.\nTry doing a reclined butterfly stretch. Sit on the floor with your legs bent into a butterfly stretch. The bottoms of your feet should be touching each other and legs bent. Recline down to the floor so you are lying on your back. Allow your legs to relax open.\nAlso try a reclined hamstring stretch. Lay on the floor with your feet straight out in front of you. Bring one knee up to your chest and gently pull your knee closer to your body with your hands. Hold here for a few moments and then switch sides.\nTry a seated forward bend. Sit on the floor with your legs out in front of you. Spread your legs open so they're at a 45 degree angle from your body. Inhale deeply and fold your torso over in front of you. Hold this position for a few seconds while you exhale. Repeat as you desire.\n\n, Exercise is one of the best remedies of the host of PMS symptoms that women experience the week or two prior to the start of their cycle. It can help relieve cramping, bloating, headaches, moodiness, aches and depression.Try to stay active the entire month to get the best PMS relief.\n\n\nStudies have shown that the more active you are, especially in regards to cardio, the less likely you are to experience intense PMS symptoms.For example, those that participated in the 150 minutes of cardio weekly had less painful and intense cramping during their cycle.\nMost health professionals recommend aiming for at least 150 minutes of aerobic activities each week. This could include walking, jogging, hiking, dancing, swimming or taking a spin class.\nIn addition to cardio, go for a day or two of strength training as well. These exercises don't affect PMS symptoms all that much, but will round out your workouts during the week.\n\n, Even if you're not planning on being active during your period, it's important to drink a lot of fluids. When you're exercising, it's even more important to drink an adequate amount of fluid to prevent dehydration.It's important to drink adequate fluids before and during your menstrual cycle. Many women experience some fluid or water retention which can be eased by ensuring you're drinking an adequate amount of water and other beverages.\nWhen you're exercising, you can help relieve the annoying feeling of being bloated or heavy. However, you'll need to take extra care to make sure you're replacing all the fluids lost through sweat.\nYou should aim for 10 to 13 glasses of clear, hydrating fluids. Aim to drink 1 to 2 ounces of water per kilogram of body weight. For example, if you weigh 70 kilograms (154 pounds), then you would need to drink between 70 and 140 ounces per day depending on your activity level.\nDefinitely skip the alcohol and caffeine during this time.Go for water, sparkling water, flavored water or decaf coffee and tea.\n\n, Even without PMS symptoms, it is important to wear clothing that is comfortable during exercise. This is especially true if you're experiencing PMS symptoms. You'll want to feel comfortable in your clothes when you may not be feeling 100%.\n\n\nTo start, go for stretchy or looser fitting clothes. You may want to go for a stretchy pair of yoga pants or a baggy t-shirt instead of a fitted top.\nAlso, if you feel uncomfortable about the heaviness of your flow (or the possible start of your flow) consider wearing dark colored pants (like black, dark grey or dark navy blue).\nAnother component to consider is your sports bra. If you experience breast tenderness or swollen breasts as part of your PMS symptoms, wear a comfortable sports bra that will give you a lot of support if you're doing an activity like jogging or using the elliptical.\n\n, Whether you're going for a swim, relaxing in the steam room or going for a jog, it's important to have the right type of products on hand to make sure you can exercise comfortably.If you're experiencing PMS symptoms, that doesn't mean you have to skip the pool or avoid swimming. Make sure to wear a tampon instead of a sanitary pad. It's a complete myth that you have to avoid the pool or ocean on your cycle.\nSome women may feel more comfortable using a sanitary pad or panty liner with exercises. These will work just as well and can be a good back up if you're worried about leaking.\nRegardless of which item you choose, you'll be OK to exercise. Even tough workouts do not cause an increase in flow.\n\n, It can be difficult to get motivated and feel comfortable enough during your cycle to exercise. However, the more proactive you are with managing your PMS symptoms, the easier it will be to stick to an exercise routine.\n\n\nTrack your symptoms on a calendar or PMS app. This can help you start treating PMS symptoms or preparing for them before they begin. This can help you avoid getting to the point where you feel horrible and don't want to exercise at all.\nA few days before you think you'll begin to experience PMS symptoms, try upping your water intake, increasing your aerobic exercise and minding your diet.\nAlso consider planning in special exercises during the upcoming week that can help relax you and ease your symptoms. For example, ask a friend to plan a few walks with you during the week, or sign up for some water aerobics classes at your gym.\n\n, Diet can play a really important role in managing PMS symptoms. There are items that can help ease PMS and even prevent some symptoms. In addition, there are foods that can aggravate them as well.Try making these changes in addition to focusing on your exercise routine:\n\n\nFocus on eating smaller meals. This can help reduce the feeling of being full or bloated during the day.\nAlso go for lean protein, fruits, 100% whole grains and vegetables. This balanced diet can help provide you with adequate amounts of iron and other essential nutrients.\nYou may want to avoid gas-producing vegetables to help minimize bloating. Consider skipping foods like beans, lentils, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.\nIn addition, skip alcohol, caffeine, salty foods or high fat foods (like fast foods, fried foods or junk food treats).\n\n, When you're experiencing PMS symptoms, it may seem easy to get overly stressed or anxious about things going on in your life. The hormone fluctuations do not make managing stress easy, so take care to find stress-relieving activities. Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and manage symptoms. The following practices can also help:\n\n\nTalk to someone. An easy way to manage stress, moodiness or depression during your cycle is by talking to a friend, family member or therapist. Spend some time together or consider working out together.\nSpend time meditating, sit down with a good book, watch a good movie or listen to your favorite music.\nConsider doing acupuncture. It's been shown to help relieve stress and some common PMS symptoms., From vitamin supplements to herbal supplements, there are a variety of over the counter items that you can take to ease PMS symptoms. Give some of these ideas a try:\n\n\nGo for a multivitamin. This all in one supplement has iron, folate and Vitamin E which are all great for PMS symptoms.\nInclude a fish oil or omega-3 supplement. Studies have shown that these healthy fats can also curb PMS symptoms.\nTry herbal remedies. There are a few herbal remedies that may also help ease PMS symptoms. Try raspberry leaf, chaste berry or valerian root supplements.\n\n, You may already rely on some of the common over-the-counter medications designed for PMS symptoms. However, these can be great medications to use proactively so you feel good enough to get in a good workout.Take ibuprofen or naproxen. These medications provide the best relief for menstrual cramps.\nIf you only experience mild cramping or headaches, you might do well with a pain reliever. Avoid a pain reliever with added caffeine.\nIf you experience a wider range of PMS symptoms, there are some medications that help relieve multiple symptoms. Most include a pain reliever, diuretic and medications to help you feel less bloated.\nRegardless of what symptoms you experience, treat them immediately. The quicker you address them, the quicker you'll feel good enough to get in a PMS relieving workout.\n\n, Holding a heating pad against your abdomen or lower back can also help to ease menstrual cramps.Try using a heating pad for 10 to 15 minutes at a time and then remove it and allow your skin to return to its normal temperature.\n\nYou can also try adhesive heating pads if you want to use one while you are on the go.\nAnother option is to take a warm bath. Try taking a bath after a workout to help soothe your cramps and relax your muscles.\n\n",

You know how when you're driving in a car and looking out the side windows, that stuff that is near you moves past you quickly, but the mountain that is miles and miles in the distance doesn't seem to move?  That phenomenon is parallax.\n\nthings that are far away don't move as much in our field of view.  Stars are incredibly far away.   If you add up the distance that the earth is from the sun from its closest and furthest (it varies throughout the year), you get about 300 million km.  So if we use the sun as our center point, we move back and forth a total of 300 million km.\n\nThe closest star to us is Proxima Centauri.  It's 4.25 light years away, that's 40.375 trillion km from earth, so to scale things down, if the earth's two opposite positions around the sun were only one meter apart, the distance from the sun to Proxima Centauri would be 134,583 km away.\n\nRemember the mountain example above.  If you were standing 134,583 km away from a visible mountain (which would be over 3 trips around the earth at the equator), and you moved one meter to the left or right, would it look like the mountain moved in your field of vision?  And that is just for the closest star to us.\n\n(edit: changed meters to kilometers for the 134,583 number)",

If it zaps your tongue let it cook for another 20 minutes and re-test. If you are leery about touching your tongue with the mix, then just take a small piece of soap and soap up your hands under running water - if it stings, then you still have lye and need to cook for another 20 minutes before rechecking.\n\n, Note: To save time, you can add the fragrance oils to the fats\/oil mixture before adding the lye\/water mixture - this will keep the soap mixture more pliable for pouring into molds.\n\n, Smooth out the top of the soap in the soap mold by using your gloves hands. Let the soap sit in the molds to cool for 24 hours. Take out and cut into bars.\n\n,, You can use wire shelves that you can buy.\n\n",

        "text":"The biggest quadcopters are comparable in size to the smallest manned helicopters. A quadcopter is based on very different principles of control and stability from other helicopters. Ordinary helicopters have a set of rotors linked together to balance the forces and then change the pitch of the rotor blades for control. This is a mechanically balanced system as any variable unknowns like the rotor speed have an equal effect on all components. However a quadcopter is a mechanically unstable system that requires constant corrections by the electronics in order to stay balanced. This means that you need motors that have a very fixed speed and can change speed very fast. So quadcopters need special electric motors. You can not build a quadcopter out of any electric motor or out of a combustion engine because these can not be controlled in the same way. This creates some issues when you attempt to scale the design. If you look at bigger quadcopters you will notice that they usually have more rotors then the four classical rotors. This helps with the scale although you can not just mount a hundred motors on a helicopter without issues.",

        "text":"I tried but couldn't come up with a way to explain this to a five year old. But I'll try to keep this as simple as possible.\n\nCorporate personhood is a legal fiction. Everyone knows that corporations are not living, breathing, farting human beings. But the law will consider them as 'people' under certain circumstances, for instance:\n\n* Paying taxes\n* Owning property\n* Getting sued \/ suing\n\nThis is because treating corporations as people makes it much easier for governments to regulate them. Let's think about this in context of lawsuits. Right now, if a driver for ACME company hits you, you can sue ACME company and collect money from it. If corporate personhood didn't exist, you would need to sue the driver individually, his manager, and then owners of the company - if ACME is a publicly traded company, it's \"owners\" are shareholders, which can number in thousands of people. It'll be just too complicated to sue ACME unless you could treat it as a legal person.\n\nNow, where things get controversial, is because the Supreme Court recently held that Congress cannot limit the timing and amount of campaign spending by corporations. In other words, corporations have First Amendment rights. As I'm sure you've seen on Reddit, this has been very controversial.\n\nBut I think it's blown out of proportion. Corporations don't have First Amendment rights because they are living, breathing, thinking people. Instead, corporations are owned and operated by real human beings who might want to organize their political activities *through* corporations - so if a government restricts a corporation's ability to, say, run campaign ads, then it necessarily restricts the people's ability to do the same thing.\n\nYou might ask, why do people have to organize through corporations? Can't they run ads on their own? Can't they form political action committees? \n\nYes, they can do all of those things, but there may be other reasons for wanting to organize in corporate form. For instance, groups like the Sierra Club, World Wildlife Federation, and the National Rifle Association might want to form as corporations for tax or regulatory purposes. Why should they be prevented from running campaign ads or donating to political campaigns?\n\nFinally, another concern is that there doesn't seem to be a principled basis for treating corporations and unions\/non-profits differently for purposes of First Amendment law. We all agree (I think) that unions and non-profits should be allowed to engage in politics by running ads, etc. But they are just as 'fictitious' legal entities as corporations. They are organizations that exist only in paper and through voluntary association of real human beings. If unions\/non-profits have First Amendment rights, it seems to follow that corporations should too.\n\nHope this answers your question.",

To sustain a C average without playing sports is one thing. But if someone sustains a C average while playing one or more sports is actually quite an undertaking.  See I play sports and I have an A average but believe me its not even relatively close to being easy.  I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements.  If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week.  That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed. ",

        "text":" Since uterine cancer affects the uterus, every woman is at risk for contracting this type of cancer (unless you’ve had a hysterectomy). However it is most common for women over the age of 50 who have gone through menopause.One major risk factor for developing uterine cancer is taking hormones or other drugs.These hormone risks include using estrogen without also using progesterone, or taking Tamoxifen – a drug used to treat certain forms of breast cancer.\nThere are also certain physical factors that can contribute to an increased risk of contracting uterine cancer. Major bodily factors include being obese, being a smoker, or having a history of uterine, colon, or ovarian cancer in your family. You are also a greater risk if you have had problems getting pregnant or if you had fewer than five periods a year before beginning menopause. Another risk factor is suffering from endometrial hyperplasia.;\n, Abnormal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding is the most common early symptom of endometrial cancer. If you notice any vaginal bleeding that is not normal for you and your monthly cycle, you should be mindful of your symptoms so that you can recall them for your doctor.If the abnormal bleeding continues for any considerable amount of time (more than a few days) or if it happens during several monthly cycles in a row, consider notifying your doctor.\nCheck for bleeding between periods. If you notice bleeding between periods, this can be a symptom of uterine cancer.Be wary of bleeding that last longer or is heavier than normal. If your menstrual cycle changes in any way, this can be a symptom of a problem with your reproductive system, including uterine cancer. Look for changes like heavier periods than normal, longer periods than normal, or increased PMS symptoms (cramps, fatigue, etc.).\nKeep a journal recording these occurrences.\n\n, Bleeding, even a small amount (also known as spotting), after having gone through menopause can be problematic for many reasons. One of these reasons is the possibility of uterine cancer. If you are vaginally bleeding after menopause, you should consult your doctor immediately.Since menopause eliminates your body’s need to go through the menstrual cycle every month, any bleeding after menopause can be problematic and should be taken seriously.\n\n, Take the time to notice if your menstrual periods last longer than seven days. A longer than average menstrual cycle can be indicative of problems with your reproductive system, including uterine cancer. Keep track of how many days your period lasts for several cycles in a row so you can tell your doctor.\n\n\nA doctor can help you regulate your periods so that they are more manageable and make sure there are no underlying problems causing the longer periods.\n\n, Pain is actually somewhat rare in early uterine cancer. It does not usually occur until later in the disease’s progression. Any kind of recurring pain in your pelvis can be a sign of a various number of potential health problems – including uterine cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and ovarian cysts. You should notify your doctor and get it checked out if you are experiencing any kind of pain or pressure in your pelvis.A feeling of pressure in your pelvis can also be a sign of uterine cancer.\nThe intensity of the sensation can vary from person to person. You might feel a sharp, stabbing pain in your pelvic region or perhaps a lighter, more continuous feeling of pressure.\n\n, It should never hurt when you urinate. If you are experiencing pain during urination, it can be a symptom of several problems including uterine cancer or urinary tract infection. Regardless, you should see your doctor immediately if you are experiencing this problem., For the most part, sexual intercourse should not be painful. If you are experiencing pain during sex, especially if it is a recent development, consider letting your doctor know just to make sure nothing is wrong.Your doctor may also be able to recommend something to alleviate the pain.\n\n, See your health care provider if you have any of the signs or symptoms listed or are concerned that you might have uterine cancer. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\nIt might be a good idea to ask a friend to go with you to your appointment. They can be there for moral support, to help you remember the information the doctor gives you, and to ask questions that you may forget in the moment.\nMake sure you prepare for your appointment ahead of time by researching your symptoms, keeping track of your symptoms, and writing down any questions you may have.\n\n, It is important to ask your doctor questions when you consult with him or her about your concerns regarding uterine cancer. Doing research on your own is a great way to find out some preliminary information, but getting information directly from your doctor is more beneficial.\n\n\nIf you often have trouble remembering all of the questions you want to ask, write your questions down ahead of time as you think of them so you’ll be sure to ask all the right things when you’re discussing it with your doctor.\nYou can also take notes during your appointment with the doctor so that you will be able to accurately recall all of the information later.\n\n, There is also no simple and trustworthy way to test for uterine cancer in women who are symptom-free. The Pap test (also known as Pap smear) does not check for uterine cancer. If you do have signs or symptoms of the cancer, your health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:\n\n\nPelvic exam\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nEndometrial biopsy\nPap test (to test for other possible causes)\n\n, Once you have tracked all of your symptoms, discussed your symptoms with your doctor, and undergone any testing your doctor deems necessary, your doctor should be able to give you an accurate diagnosis about whether or not you have uterine cancer.\n\n\nKeep in mind that your doctor may need to do some tests on your before they can make a definitive decision about your symptoms.\n\n",

        "text":"In chemistry, a superoxide is a compound that contains the superoxide ion, which has the chemical formula . The systematic name of the anion is dioxide(1−). The reactive oxygen ion superoxide is particularly important as the product of the one-electron reduction of dioxygen , which occurs widely in nature.  Molecular oxygen (dioxygen) is a diradical containing two unpaired electrons, and superoxide results from the addition of an electron which fills one of the two degenerate molecular orbitals, leaving a charged ionic species with a single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of −1.  Both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism. Superoxide was historically also known as \"hyperoxide\".\n\nSalts\n\nSuperoxide forms salts with alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. The salts caesium superoxide (), rubidium superoxide (), potassium superoxide (), and sodium superoxide () are prepared by the reaction of  with the respective alkali metal.\n\nThe alkali salts of  are orange-yellow in color and quite stable, if they are kept dry. Upon dissolution of these salts in water, however, the dissolved  undergoes disproportionation (dismutation) extremely rapidly (in a pH-dependent manner):\n\n2 O2- + H2O -> 3\/2 O2 + 2 OH-\n\nThis reaction (with moisture and carbon dioxide in exhaled air) is the basis of the use of potassium superoxide as an oxygen source in chemical oxygen generators, such as those used on the Space Shuttle and on submarines. Superoxides are also used in firefighters' oxygen tanks to provide a readily available source of oxygen. In this process,  acts as a Brønsted base, initially forming the hydroperoxyl radical ().\n\nThe superoxide anion, , and its protonated form, hydroperoxyl, are in equilibrium in an aqueous solution:\nO2- + H2O <=> HO2 + OH-\n\nGiven that the hydroperoxyl radical has a pKa of around 4.8, superoxide predominantly exists in the anionic form at neutral pH.\n\nPotassium superoxide is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (facilitated by crown ethers) and is stable as long as protons are not available. Superoxide can also be generated in aprotic solvents by cyclic voltammetry.\n\nSuperoxide salts also decompose in the solid state, but this process requires heating:\n\n2 NaO2  -> Na2O2  +  O2\n\nBiology\nSuperoxide and hydroperoxyl () are often discussed interchangeably, although superoxide predominates at physiological pHs. Both superoxide and hydroperoxyl are classified as reactive oxygen species. It is generated by the immune system to kill invading microorganisms. In phagocytes, superoxide is produced in large quantities by the enzyme NADPH oxidase for use in oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms of invading pathogens. Mutations in the gene coding for the NADPH oxidase cause an immunodeficiency syndrome called chronic granulomatous disease, characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection, especially catalase-positive organisms. In turn, micro-organisms genetically engineered to lack the superoxide-scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) lose virulence. Superoxide is also deleterious when produced as a byproduct of mitochondrial respiration (most notably by Complex I and Complex III), as well as several other enzymes, for example xanthine oxidase, which can catalyze the transfer of electrons directly to molecular oxygen under strongly reducing conditions.\n\nBecause superoxide is toxic at high concentrations, nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen express SOD. SOD efficiently catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide:\n2 HO2  ->  O2  +  H2O2\nOther proteins that can be both oxidized and reduced by superoxide (such as hemoglobin) have weak SOD-like activity. Genetic inactivation (\"knockout\") of SOD produces deleterious phenotypes in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice and have provided important clues as to the mechanisms of toxicity of superoxide in vivo.\n\nYeast lacking both mitochondrial and cytosolic SOD grow very poorly in air, but quite well under anaerobic conditions. Absence of cytosolic SOD causes a dramatic increase in mutagenesis and genomic instability. Mice lacking mitochondrial SOD (MnSOD) die around 21 days after birth due to neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, and lactic acidosis. Mice lacking cytosolic SOD (CuZnSOD) are viable but suffer from multiple pathologies, including reduced lifespan, liver cancer, muscle atrophy, cataracts, thymic involution, haemolytic anemia, and a very rapid age-dependent decline in female fertility.\n\nSuperoxide may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases (the evidence is particularly strong for radiation poisoning and hyperoxic injury), and perhaps also to aging via the oxidative damage that it inflicts on cells. While the action of superoxide in the pathogenesis of some conditions is strong (for instance, mice and rats overexpressing CuZnSOD or MnSOD are more resistant to strokes and heart attacks), the role of superoxide in aging must be regarded as unproven, for now. In model organisms (yeast, the fruit fly Drosophila, and mice), genetically knocking out CuZnSOD shortens lifespan and accelerates certain features of aging: (cataracts, muscle atrophy, macular degeneration, and thymic involution). But the converse, increasing the levels of CuZnSOD, does not seem to consistently increase lifespan (except perhaps in Drosophila). The most widely accepted view is that oxidative damage (resulting from multiple causes, including superoxide) is but one of several factors limiting lifespan.\n\nThe binding of  by reduced () heme proteins involves formation of Fe(III) superoxide complex.\n\nAssay in biological systems\nThe assay of superoxide generated in biological systems is a difficult task because of its high reactivity and short half-life. One approach that has been used in quantitative assays converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is relatively stable. Hydrogen peroxide is then assayed by a fluorimetric method. As a free radical, superoxide has a strong EPR signal, and it is possible to detect superoxide directly using this method when it is abundant enough. For practical purposes, this can be achieved only in vitro under non-physiological conditions, such as high pH (which slows the spontaneous dismutation) with the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Researchers have developed a series of tool compounds termed \"spin traps\" that can react with superoxide, forming a meta-stable radical (half-life 1–15 minutes), which can be more readily detected by EPR. Superoxide spin-trapping was initially carried out with DMPO, but phosphorus derivatives with improved half-lives, such as DEPPMPO and DIPPMPO, have become more widely used.\n\nBonding and structure\nSuperoxides are compounds in which the oxidation number of oxygen is −. Whereas molecular oxygen (dioxygen) is a diradical containing two unpaired electrons, the addition of a second electron fills one of its two degenerate molecular orbitals, leaving a charged ionic species with single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of −1.  Both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism.\n\nThe derivatives of dioxygen have characteristic O–O distances that correlate with the order of the O–O bond.\n\nSee also\n Oxygen, O2\n Ozonide, \n Peroxide, \n Oxide, O2−\n Dioxygenyl, \nAntimycin A – used in fishery management, this compound produces large quantities of this free radical.\nParaquat – used as a herbicide, this compound produces large quantities of this free radical.\n Xanthine oxidase – This form of the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase produces large amounts of superoxide.\n\nReferences\n\nAnions\nOxygen compounds\nOxyanions\nImmune system\n \nFree radicals\nReactive oxygen species",

        "text":"[EDIT: The thoughtful author responses addressed my major concerns. The github links for data and code will be really helpful for reproducing results (I haven't looked carefully, but this is great). The revision addressed many issues, including the additional results. As such I am upgrading my rating from a 5 to a 6 and recommend acceptance of the paper.]\n\nThe paper proposes to apply deep nets to perform detection and localization of extreme weather events in simulated weather data. The problem is related to object detection in computer vision in that the input is a 2D “image” (multichannel spatial weather data) or 3D “video” (temporal version of the data) and the output is a bounding box (spatial-temporal localization of a weather event) and class label (weather event type). It differs from standard object detection in that the input has multiple heterogenous channels and labeled data is scarce.\n\nA simple but quite reasonable deep net is proposed for the task based on similar approaches in computer vision. While proposal based systems are most popular in vision currently (in particular Faster-RCNN) the proposed approach is simple and a fine starting point. There is little innovation on the part of the detection system, but as noted, it is a valid application of ideas from computer vision to the task at hand. \n\nThe authors propose both a supervised approach (only ground truth bounding box location\/label is used) and a semi-supervised approach that additionally incorporates the reconstruction loss as a regularization. In all cases the losses are fairly standard and again, reasonable. The only confusing bit is that the “semi-supervised” loss actually has all the labels used for the “supervised” loss and additionally incorporates the reconstruction loss. Hence, the “semi-supervised” loss is actually stronger, which makes the terminology a bit confusing.\n\nThe paper is easy to follow, but notation is sloppy. For example, above equation 5 it states that “the loss is a weighted combination of reconstruction error and bounding box regression loss”; actually it’s a combination of the supervised and unsupervised loss (Lsup and Lunsup), and Lrec is not defined (although I assume Lrec=Lunsup). The paper is fairly non-technical, but nevertheless these minor issues should be fixed. (E.g., see also reference to “figure 4 and 4”). \n\nThe biggest concern w the paper though is experimental results. Only a single figure and table of results are shown (figure 4 and table 4). The metrics are not defined (what is mean average recall?). Only 2D versus 3D version of the model are shown, and supervised and semi-supervised. Moreover, numbers seem a bit all over the place, without consistent patterns (e.g., why is 2D supervised better than the seemingly much strong 3D semi-supervised?). One of the things that is unclear is how many events are actually in the training\/testing data, and more importantly, how good are these results in absolute terms? Regardless, the experiments are fairly sparse and ablation studies and more discussion lacking. It is also unclear if future researchers will be able to reproduce the experimental setting (a commitment to open-source the data or a way to reproduce the experiments would be critical for future authors).\n\nMinor nit: the authors use both a classification loss and an “objectness” loss. I’ve never seen both used together like this (normally objectness is used in two-stage object proposal systems where in the first stage class-agnostic proposals are given and in the second stage these are cropped and a class-specific classifier is applied). I strongly suspect removing the objectness loss would not impact results since the classification loss should provide strictly stronger supervisory signal. Regardless, this is a fairly non-standard choice and should be justified (experimentally).\n\nOverall this is a borderline paper. I do believe that it is valuable to apply computer vision techniques to a domain that I’ve see little work on in our community. That being said, I have no expertise on this type of data -- it’s possible this deep learning techniques are now routinely used in the climate science literature (I suspect not, though). Overall, there is little novelty on the algorithmic side in this paper (the equations in section 3 are commonly used in the cv literature). The use of reconstruction loss to improve results in the data-sparse setting is interesting, but the experimental results are inconclusive. The experimental validation is generally insufficient. Reproducibility for future research is difficult unless the data is open-sourced. Overall, I think this paper is a good start, and with improved experiments and more careful writing I think could eventually make for a decent paper.",

Do you feel some emotion by listening to 4'33\"? \n\nThe fact you're asking, \"how is this music?\" Is the point of that piece of music. John Cage was a part of the \"musique concrete\" movement of composition, the entire goal was to ask what could be considered music or not. By making a piece that is entirely silent, and one that forces you to listen to every single detail of the environment instead of the ensemble on stage (I encourage you to experience this live), Cage was asking that question in the most blatant and ridiculous way. \n\nCage also did a lot of other wacky shit, as did his contemporaries in the movement. The historical significance on composition of Cage, 4'33\" being his best known work, is almost unrivaled in the 20th century next to that of Stravinsky, Webern, and Bartok. The question asked by 4'33\" is answered by Jazz, Rock n' Roll, contemporary art music, and electronic music that is on the top 40 charts today. \n\nNow I know that seems ridiculous, absurd, pretentious and even stupid. But that's sort of the point. It's half tongue in cheek, half high art. And that's the beauty of 4'33\". You can throw 5 minutes of analysis at it and say \"fuck you Cage\" and he would say, \"awesome.\" Or you can write a 10 page paper on it and get it published in a musicology or music theory journal. And he'd say the discourse on the piece of music, the spectrum of interpretation from \"fuck you\" to \"greatest piece ever written\" is the entire point of the composition, the movement he was a part of, and the ethos of music he believed in. The value of the piece and experience of listening to it is in how it brings emotion to the listener, promotes thought, and encourages discussion. \n\nAnd to throw in something to convince you more, Claude Debussy (great French Impressionist composer) once said that \"music is in the space between notes.\" 4'33\" takes that quote to the extreme, almost as a callback to the roots of *musique concrete.* What is the musical value of silence? So going back to the question at the top of this post... did silence, the lack of sound, elicit an emotion from you as a listener? Enough that you posted to the internet about it. So was it music? Did it have musical value, a piece entirely made of silence?",

Since this affects how you'll dress out your birds, it's important to find out how they'll be checked if and when the game warden comes calling.\n\n\nDuck hunting regulations vary widely. In some areas, you'll only be allowed to collect a certain number of duck per day, so it's a good idea to be up-to-date on the specific regulations in your area. Federal guidelines can be found here, while local regulations can be found on the website of the Department of Natural Resources or the Hunting and Finishing bureau in your state.;\n, When you collect a duck, it'll have been floating around in pond water, rolling in the mud, and probably mouthed by your golden retriever for a couple minutes before you got to it. In other words, it's pretty dirty, and it's important to take a few minutes to clean it up a bit before packing it up or dressing it out to keep the meat from spoiling.Clean any dirt and fecal matter from the feathers, especially around the tail of the duck. Dry it thoroughly and pack it in a cooler, or start dressing it immediately, depending on your intentions. Below 40 F, a duck carcass will be fine for 3-5 days in clean conditions, without doing anything.\nLocate the shot and keep track of it. The meat around the area the pellets(s) entered will be scorched and less than tasty. You'll need to be careful to remove any shot from the carcass, and to trim away any meat around the area later, so it's a good idea to clean it out now.\n\n, Letting meat dry out some will intensify the flavor in the right ways, reducing gaminess and making your duck more tasty. In the right conditions, you can do this without dressing the bird out, or you can do it after you've skinned or dressed the bird. Either way is fine for a clean bird.\n\n\nIf the temperature is right, you can hang birds upside down by their feet to drain out, in a shed or garage, as long as it's cool enough. Otherwise, keeping them in plastic bins in the refrigerator is also fine, as long as there's enough air circulation.\nDifferent hunters like to dress out the birds at different points in the process. If you're out and going to collect lots of birds, it's likely you'll want to breast them out in the field as quickly as possible to keep down on your baggage. Alternatively, it's perfectly fine to keep the ducks whole, get them on ice quickly, and wait a couple days before dressing them in the right conditions.\n\n, Skinning a duck is much faster and easier, especially in the field. Depending on how you'd like to cook your duck, though, some people prefer to leave the skin on, which means a more time-intensive plucking process needs to happen. Both ways are perfectly acceptable and will be covered below.\n\n\nIt's sometimes better to skin diver ducks and ducks shot around salt water. The fatty skin can sometimes taste a little fishy and be orange-colored, if the duck has consumed a lot of shellfish.\nIt's fine to pluck all others kinds of ducks, if you want to take the time. Foodies and gourmands agree: cooked properly, the crispy skin of a roast duck can be one of the most desirable parts of the meal. The skin is especially fatty, meaning that it can imbue the meat with lots of flavor. If you can take the time to save the skin, many people think it's well worth it.\n\n",

Two stations of plastic scintillators located\nupstream and downstream from the muon target were used to reconstruct the decay\nspectrum of muons. In a complementary method to detect negatively-charged\nmuons, the X-ray spectrum yielded by muonic atoms in the target were measured\nin a germanium detector. Measurements, at a proton beam current of 6 pA,\nyielded $(10.4 \\pm 2.7) \\times 10^5$ muons per Watt of proton beam power\n($\\mu^+$ and $\\mu^-$), far in excess of other facilities. At full beam power\n(400 W), this implies a rate of muons of $(4.2 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^8$ muons\ns$^{-1}$, amongst the highest in the world. The number of $\\mu^-$ measured was\nabout a factor of 10 lower, again by far the most efficient muon beam produced.\nThe set up is a prototype for future experiments requiring a high-intensity\nmuon beam, such as a muon collider or neutrino factory, or the search for rare\nmuon decays which would be a signature for phenomena beyond the Standard Model\nof particle physics. Such a muon beam can also be used in other branches of\nphysics, nuclear and condensed matter, as well as other areas of scientific\nresearch.\n",

        "text":"Verbania (, , ) is the most populous comune (municipality) and the capital city of the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola in the Piedmont region of northwest Italy. It is situated on the shore of Lake Maggiore, about  north-west of Milan and about  from Locarno in Switzerland. It had a population of 30,827 at 1 January 2017.\n\nHistory\n\nThe area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The oldest known people living in the \narea were the Lepontii. The area was added to the Roman Empire by Emperor Augustus in the first century AD.\n\nIn the eleventh century the area was controlled by the bishops of Novara, then by the counts of Pombia. In 1152 Federico Barbarossa gave the area to the Castello family. After the death of Frederick Barbarossa, the territory was again controlled by Novara. By the fourteenth century, the area had become part of the Duchy of Milan. In 1714, following the Treaty of Rastatt most of the lake areas came under the control of the Habsburgs. After the  1796 Napoleonic invasion the area was controlled by the French. By 1818 the House of Savoy had gained control of the area back from the French. With the edict of 10 October 1836, Pallanza and Ossola became part of the province of Novara.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the territory still remained part of the province of Novara. In 1976 the autonomous district of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola was established.\n\nOverview\n\nIt faces the city of Stresa lying at a direct distance of  across Lake Maggiore, and  by road.  The present-day Verbania was created by the 1939 merger of the cities of Intra and Pallanza under royal decree 702. Since 1992 it has been the capital of the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola.  A small islet lying a stone's throw from the shores of the Pallanza frazione and separated from it by a narrow stretch of water just 10 or 15 metres wide, known as the Isolino di San Giovanni, is famous for having been the home of Arturo Toscanini between the years of 1927 and 1952.\n\nVerbania consists of the following localities: Antoliva, Bieno, Biganzolo, Cavandone, Fondotoce, Intra, Pallanza, Possaccio, Suna, Torchiedo, Trobaso and Zoverallo.\n\nClimate\nThe climate is temperate, humid, with hot summer and continental type influences in the inland and higher areas. The area is characterized by cold winters and hot summers.\n\nGovernment\n\nMain sights\n\nGiardini Botanici Villa Taranto is an estate with fine botanical gardens.\n\nTransport\nVerbania-Pallanza railway station, opened in 1905, forms part of the Milan–Domodossola railway.  It is in the Fondotoce district, between Lake Mergozzo and the river Toce, just upstream from where the Toce flows into Lake Maggiore. A bus connects Verbania to the rail station in Fondotoce.\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns – Sister cities\nVerbania is twinned with the following cities and towns:\n\n  Bourg-de-Péage, France\n   Crikvenica, Croatia\n   East Grinstead, United Kingdom\n   Mindelheim, Germany\n  Sant Feliu de Guíxols, Spain\n Schwaz, Austria\n  Piatra Neamț, Romania\n Hendersonville, North Carolina, USA\n\nNotable people\n Beniamino Bonomi (b. 1968), canoeist\n Emanuela Brizio (b. 1968), mountain runner\n Luigi Cadorna (1850–1928), Field Marshal of Italy during World War I\n Raffaele Cadorna, Jr. (1889–1973), general\n Filippo Ganna (b. 1996), cyclist\n Wilfried Gnonto (b. 2003), footballer\n Elisa Longo Borghini (b. 1991), cyclist\n Emma Morano (1899–2017), former world's oldest living person from 12 May 2016 until her death on 15 April 2017\n Angelo Pagotto (b. 1973), footballer\n Daniele Ranzoni (1843-1889), artist\n Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866), mathematician\n\nSee also\n S.S.

To throw the ball you don't have to have it in both hands you can use the palm of your hand of a closed fist anything. If you're laying on the floor, you must extend your arms all the way up to throw the ball. If you're on your knees, then you should throw it a bit above your head height.\n\n, Scoring every time your opponent does not get to the ball in time and the ball hits the floor you are awarded 1 point to a preset number usually 2 sets of 21 if it continues to be a draw then go to penalties.\n\n, If you throw the ball out of the ring or the last person to touch the ball (that is if it's a legal throw) a point is awarded to the other player. If you catch the ball and you slide out of the circle court it is OK as long a tiny bit of your body still in the court. Hitting the ball on the line does count as in.\n\n, To start you flip a coin the winner of the coin flip is in the center of the circle court. The loser of the flip has there feet touching the circle but the rest of his body out of the court (laying down) they must throw the ball. As soon as he does he can get up the person can then throw it anywhere in the circle. Alternating. If it's a penalty from a foul then the fouler is the one laying down. If this is the start of the game or the start of a point you cannot win.\n\n, To play doubles or triples its the same rules but you must have an order so you always throw to the same player once the point is over alternate so you throw now only to the other player. During the start, penalty or foul two players must be anywhere outside the circle until the person laying down has the ball.\n\n\nFor Uneven numbers, You go around in a pattern until someone says at the end a point switch and then the order reverses. Penalty, foul, beginning of game and point you do it normally with the extra player out on the side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Last team to have players left wins.\n\n, This game has no preset court; it can be square, circle (usually it's a circle), oval. Just make it the correct size fitted for who you playing with and have fun!\n\n, Same rules as doubles but no set person to throw to just anyone on the other team.\n\n",

        "text":" You can also boulder outdoors, but you'll need to find out about safe, established bouldering sites before getting on a rock. Moreover, outdoor sites are usually more difficult, and require guides and deeper knowledge of rock formations. Rock gyms are safe, well-designed spaces for a variety of skill levels, and they often have classes and staff to help you learn. In general, you have two options starting out:\n\n\n\nBouldering routes are short rock climbing problems that don't require harnesses or ropes, and are a fantastic way to build your climbing skills safely, without complex introductions to belaying or equipment. Since these problems require no ropes certain constraints that come with roped climbing are avoided. Bouldering routes are great for learning to climb and are a fun way to climb although you lack the safety that you would have with a rope.\n\nTop-roping is what most people think of when they think of rock climbing. You're tied in and scaling a large wall. In order to top-rope you'll need a partner. If you're brand new to the sport, check with the staff about \"belay partners,\" or boulder until you feel comfortable asking for a partner.;\n, Rock climbing shoes need to be snug so that you can feel the precise edges of the rock. They may feel uncomfortable at first, as the toes are often pointed in order to help you stay on small chips and edges, but you'll get used to them quickly. Just make sure they don't cut off circulation. Chalk bags, while not necessary, are used to keep your hands dry -- essential for holding onto the rock as you get tired. Simply dip you fingers lightly in the chalk and clap them together so you have a light chalky dusting on your hands.\n\n\nHarnesses, clips, and belay devices are necessary if you're top-roping. The remainder of this section assumes you are already tied in, or are bouldering.\n\n, Most walls are marked by routes -- specific sets of rock that you must use to get to the top. While these are more challenging and fun for experts, you need to get comfortable with the height, the holds, and the general feel of climbing first. Ignore the tape marks and just head up the wall, working on the basics of your form. Once you're comfortable climbing, you're ready to start tackling some basic routes.\n\n\nIf you really want to get to routes, looks for one labeled 5.4 or 5.5, which are good beginner ratings. (In French, sport grades are commonly used. These will be 3 or 3+, 4 or 4+.)\nThe fear of falling and the fear of heights are perfectly normal human instincts. Remember, however, that you have a bevy of safety equipment, padded floors, and a knowledgeable person holding you up. After your first few slips, you'll get used to it.\nStarting with an expert, even just a friend who climbs often, is a great way to break slowly into the sport.\n\n, This is the number one rule of good climbing, and the hardest thing to get used to. It feels natural to pull your body up the wall because your fingers feel like they're more firmly locked onto the holds. But your legs are much, much stronger muscles, and you'll tire out halfway up the wall if you're trying to do ten consecutive pull-ups. There are a couple of surefire tips to get accustomed to using your legs:\n\n\nKeep your arms extended. Let your weight hang low, gripping the hand holds purely for balance and bending your knees for power.\nSet your feet before moving your hands. Get good, solid footholds that you can put weight on.\nKeep your weight on your toes, not on your hands, by dropping your heels lower than your toes., If you're struggling to reach a handhold with your left hand, you don't have to become Mr. Fantastic to grab it. You need to move your left foot higher -- elongating your left side and making the reach easier. Climbing is a deliberate, thoughtful sport, and muscling up the wall will only get you so far. Stop to think about the best way up a route, or ask experienced climbers for advice.\n\n\nLearning to read a route from the ground, visualizing where your hands and feet will go in advance, is an essential skill you can never start practicing too soon.\nThe more time you spend gripping the wall, unsure where to go, the more tired you'll get.\nThe set of moves you use to get up a wall is called your \"beta.\", Most routes have 1-2 spots where you can catch your breath and loosen your muscles. A good rest spot is anywhere you can comfortably stand with most of your weight on your feet. You should be able to take one arm comfortably off the wall to get chalk and stretch out. While resting:\n\n\nPlan out your next few moves. Memorize what footholds you have coming up and think about which limb you want to go where. If needed, ask someone at the bottom for advice.\nRe-chalk your hands. Chalk runs off on rocks, so get some more.\nShake out your arms. Let them hang and give them a good shake to dislodge some of the lactic acid that has built up., There are advanced moves that require speed, rapid precision, and even small leaps (called \"dynos\"), but these are for later in your career. For now, you want to focus on fluid motion. The best way to do this is to focus on each limb first, then move your body. Also known as \"static climbing technique,\" you move each limb, get set, then move your body over into the new position. Think of yourself as a slinky, coiling and uncoiling up the wall.\n\n\nSet your feet, knees bent.\nShift your body weight the direction you're headed.\nStep up with a foot while simultaneously grabbing a new hold with the matching hand.\nRe-set your feet and opposite hand.\nRepeat., One of the biggest hurdles for new climbers is that they feel weak after only 1-2 runs. Your fingers will be sore and your forearms will be burning, so much so that you don't feel like you can even hold onto the wall anymore. This is natural, however -- your forearms are not frequently used at this intensity in everyday life. However, if you climb a few routes 2-3 times a week you'll quickly get over this hump and can focus on climbing technique, not how sore your arms are.\n\n\nTake rest breaks in between climbs. Don't get back on the wall until your feel rested again.\nStretch your forearms by clasping your palms in front of your chest and elbows out as if you were praying. Slowly rotate your hands down until they point in front of you to stretch.",

This is the system used to elect the president of the United States, but most people (60% of Americans, according to source 1) believe that we shouldn't use this particular system and that we should go with the popular vote instead, while all others are strong in their stance that we should continue its use  Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the oposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote.\n \nThe Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1)  Some people don't even bother voting due to the fact that their vote will not contribute to their favored candidate's election. This happens often when a democratic voter lives in a republican state, and vice versa (source 3)  Many people stand by the Electoral College as the best course of action. They argue that the certainty of the winner is better, a candidate can't win the election due to regional favor, and this system unsures that there will still be a clear winner even when each candidate recieves the same percentage of votes.  We began using the Electoral College in order to ensure that states with low populations weren't ignored by presidential campaigns  However, it fails to do just that  Presidential candidates focus their attention to swing states, in order to win their electoral votes. Candidates have little to no need to campaign in states that have a majority of one party, because their vote is either a lost cause or all but garunteed. If this system does not do the job that it was originally intended for, then why do we continue to use it?  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.   ",

The mission added two more components to the ISS and brought supplies for its crew.\n\nDuring and after the mission, the media focused heavily on a small puncture in the heat shield, created by a piece of insulation foam that came off the external tank during liftoff, though the foam impact that ultimately destroyed Columbia caused more damage and was in a critical area. KSC Launch Director Michael D. Leinbach mentioned in the post-flight news conference that upon initial inspection on the ground, \"Endeavour appears to be the 'cleanest' post-flight orbiter since Return to Flight\". On August 31, 2007, NASA reported that the damaged tiles had been removed in the Orbiter Processing Facility, and engineers had found no evidence of heat-related damage to the orbiter itself.\n\nCrew\n\nCrew notes \nAstronaut Clayton Anderson was originally slated to be launched to the ISS on this mission, but was moved to STS-117. His replacement was Alvin Drew\n\nNASA press releases and media briefing documents stated that STS-118 was the first flight of a Mission Specialist Educator due to the presence of Barbara Morgan. The Educator Astronaut Project is the successor to NASA's Teacher in Space Project, which ended with the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. The official STS-118 mission patch included a flame of knowledge that represented the importance of education, and honored teachers and students everywhere. Morgan was the backup to Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who was killed aboard Challenger in 1986. The tip of the flames touched Morgan's name on the patch. However, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin clarified at a post-mission press conference that Morgan was not considered a mission specialist educator, but rather a standard mission specialist, who had once been a teacher.\n\nPrior to the Columbia disaster, the crew manifest for STS-118 was:\n\nMission payloads\n\nThe STS-118 mission delivered and assembled the starboard S5 truss segment of the International Space Station, as well as External Stowage Platform 3, (ESP-3) and a replacement Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG). The mission was also the final flight to include the Spacehab Logistics Single Module.\n\nThe Spacehab Logistics Single Module, a pressurized aluminum habitat that is carried inside the payload bay, has a capacity of , and carried a variety of cargo and research projects, including supply materials for the ISS. It returned cargo, including the MISSE PEC 3 & 4, a Department of Defense payload that had been installed on the ISS. Launched in July 2006, the MISSE PEC-3 and 4 contained over 850 materials specimens that will be studied to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the environment of space.\n\nMission background\n\nThe mission was originally scheduled to be flown by Columbia; STS-118 would have marked that orbiter's 29th flight and its first visit to the International Space Station. However, the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster altered the planned flight schedules, and the mission was rescheduled for Endeavour. STS-118 served as Endeavours return to flight after a planned orbiter re-fit and maintenance period that resulted in over 200 modifications to the orbiter.\n\nOne of the most important modifications that debuted during STS-118 is an upgraded power-distribution module, the Station-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS). SSPTS allows Endeavour to tap into the ISS power supply, converting up to eight kilowatts of electrical power from 120-volts direct-current (120VDC) ISS main voltage to the 28VDC system used by the orbiter. SSPTS was outfitted to the ISS Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA2) during STS-116. These upgrades will allow orbiters to remain docked at the station for an additional three to four mission days by saving cryogenic liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to run the fuel cells which generate electricity aboard the orbiter; oxygen and hydrogen tank capacity is a major factor limiting the duration of orbiter free flights. Other systems debuting on this flight were a three-string GPS system, which replaces the three Tactical Air Navigation-units, used to guide the shuttle and calculate its position during reentry and landing and the new Advanced Health Management System which keeps an eye on the three main engines (SSMEs) during liftoff and will shut them down before any catastrophic damage might develop. (All SSMEs had their own computers to regulate, monitor, and shut them down in case of trouble; the new system extends and improves the monitoring capability for increased safety.) Endeavour also received several systems that the other orbiters had already been equipped with, such as a glass cockpit, improved wing leading-edge sensors and the OBSS.\n\nSTS-118 included mission specialist Barbara Morgan, the first mission specialist educator. Morgan trained as the backup to Christa McAuliffe, NASA's Teacher in Space candidate from 1985 to 1986. McAuliffe was killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986. While McAuliffe and Morgan were classified as spaceflight participants and not as mission specialists in 1986, after the Teacher in Space Project was canceled, Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee and continued to work with NASA's Education Division until her selection as NASA's first mission specialist educator in 1998. Morgan completed two years of training and evaluation and began official duties in 2000. An Educator Astronaut is a fully trained astronaut who performs all the same duties that a regular astronaut does. Morgan became the first mission specialist educator in space on STS-118, and will share what she learned from the experience with students during and after her flight.\n\nThe mission marked:\n 150th crewed US space launch\n 119th Space Shuttle flight\n 22nd International Space Station assembly mission\n 20th flight of Endeavour\n 94th Post-Challenger mission\n 6th Post-Columbia mission\n First flight with SSPTS\n\nMission timeline\n\nLaunch preparations\n\nEndeavour (OV-105) was moved from the Orbiter Processing Facility, bay OPF-2 to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 2, 2007. On July 10, 2007, Endeavour moved from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Launch Pad 39A. Moving at less than one mile per hour (\/h) atop the crawler-transporter, the move began at 20:10 EDT, and was \"hard down\" (secured in place at the pad) at 03:02 EDT, July 11, 2007.\n\nThe crew completed the terminal countdown demonstration test on July 19, 2007, and the Flight Readiness Review meetings were held on July 25–26, 2007, after which NASA managers declared STS-118 a \"GO\" for launch. The launch was delayed one day to repair a valve in the shuttle's crew cabin pressurization system.\n\nCommander Kelly and the crew arrived at Kennedy Space Center on August 3, 2007, for final launch preparations. The countdown clock began at 20:00 EDT August 5, 2007, for the launch at 18:36 EDT on August 8, 2007.\n\nWednesday August 8 (Flight day 1, Launch)\n\nFueling of the external tank began at 08:11 EDT (12:11 UTC) and finished around 11:00 EDT. The Ice Team began their inspection of the orbiter to ensure no ice was on the orbiter or the fuel tank, something unlikely due to the unusually warm conditions as launch time approached. Their inspection concluded about 40 minutes quicker than the usual two-hour duration. The crew departed for the Operations & Checkout (O&C) building, for the launch pad at 14:46 EDT (18:46 UTC), and arrived at the pad at 15:02 EDT (19:02 UTC). Launch occurred at 18:36:42 EDT (22:36:42 UTC).Countdown and launch notes: The Ice Team members discovered a small crack in the foam surrounding the external fuel tank during their preflight examination. After a review by the Mission Management Team, it was concluded that there was no debris issue regarding the crack, and the tank was safe to fly.\n A problem with the switches associated with the crew hatch required a second and third hatch closure attempt. Hatch closure was completed and verified at 17:23 EDT (21:23 UTC).\n The high-definition video camera used to inspect the shuttle from Kennedy Space Center during launch failed prior to liftoff. The launch team decided that the cameras on the external tank and the orbiter would be sufficient for observations, and went on to launch without it.\n The final forecast predicted 80% go for launch weather.\n Launch Director Mike Leinbach conducted his T-9 poll, and declared Endeavour a \"go\" for launch at 18:26 EDT (22:26 UTC).\n Liftoff occurred at 18:36:42 pm EDT. (22:36:42 UTC)\n Solid Rocket Boosters successfully separated at 18:39 pm EDT (22:39 UTC).\n Main Engine Cutoff occurred at 18:45:30 pm EDT (22:45:30 UTC)\n External Tank separation occurred at 18:45:45 pm EDT (22:45:45 UTC)\n\nThe primary TAL site was Zaragoza Airport in Spain.\n\nFollowing the procedures for post-ascent, the crew opened the payload bay doors, activated the Spacehab, powered up the Remote Manipulator System, and performed a variety of other payload activation procedures, before entering their scheduled sleep shift at 04:36 UTC (12:36 am EDT) August 9, 2007.\n\nThursday August 9 (Flight day 2)\nThe shuttle crew spent most of the day inspecting the outer hull and the heat shield. During the mission status briefing, Deputy Shuttle Program Manager (and Mission Management Team chairman) John Shannon reported that during launch, approximately nine pieces of foam were observed breaking off the external fuel tanks. Three of these struck the shuttle. All three strikes are considered to be minor in nature.\n\nFriday August 10 (Flight day 3)\n\nEndeavour successfully docked with the International Space Station at 18:02 UTC (14:02 EDT). Approximately an hour before docking, Endeavour performed the one-degree-per-second backflip, called the Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver (RPM), so the ISS crew members could take digital pictures of the heat shield of the orbiter. The images were then analyzed by NASA's Image Analysis Team, as well as the Mission Management Team to inspect the integrity of the orbiter's heat shield. Following a series of leak checks, the hatches were opened at 20:04 UTC (16:04 EDT), and the Expedition 15 crew welcomed the STS-118 crew aboard the station.\n\nAfter preliminary review of the photos taken by the Expedition 15 crew during the RPM, an area of interest was discovered on the underside of the Shuttle; an area behind the right landing gear door covered with black silica tiles. The tile directly aft of the door had a  by  gouge in it. While the tile was penetrated, the underlying felt backing was not. NASA noted in the press conference that launch-time video confirmed a foam strike. This area is less critical than the leading-edge reinforced carbon-carbon tiles that were damaged in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, but did cause concern for the Mission Management Team. A focused inspection was scheduled for August 12, 2007, to determine whether a patch attempt would be undertaken by the astronauts during an EVA. NASA once reported that pieces of foam are bound to, and have fallen off of the external tank during the eight and a-half-minute ride to orbit. An unprecedented 300 pieces of foam once struck the underside of an orbiter during launch.\n\nThe crew activated the Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) after docking. The SSPTS transfers electrical power from the station to the shuttle, allowing the shuttle to conserve its own power generating resources. An extension of the mission from 11 to 14 days was dependent on proper operation of the SSPTS.\n\nSaturday August 11 (Flight day 4)\n\nAt 21:45 (UTC), Rick Mastracchio and Dave Williams started the first EVA of the mission, installing the S5 truss to the station, increasing the total mass of the ISS to . The EVA duration was 6 hours and 17 minutes, and all objectives were successfully completed.\n\nDuring the Mission Status press conference, Lead ISS Flight Director Joel Montalbano reported that the SSPTS was working well, and the recommendation to the Mission Management Team will be to extend the mission to the planned 14-day mission.\n\nMission Management Team chair John Shannon reported after additional analysis, it appeared that a piece of foam came off the external tank in the area of the tank's feed line, and bounced off a nearby strut, resulting in a hit to the orbiter's underside. An almost identical section of foam was lost on STS-115, but did not strike the orbiter. John reported after further review of photos taken on flight day three, they do not feel the damage went all the way through the tile, but focused inspection is still planned for flight day five, and decisions would not be made until more information is obtained. Five specific areas will be inspected during focused inspection, and with the data gathered, thermal testing can be done to determine what actions, if any, need to be taken.\n\nOverall, John Shannon classified the foam loss as a \"concern\", but only with regards to the history that the specific area has with regards to foam loss in past missions. Shannon reported that analysis would be complete by flight day 7 at the latest.\n\nJohn Shannon also reported that the possible protruding gap filler noticed on flight day 3, was reviewed further, and was determined to be \"shim stock\", which will burn off in the upper atmosphere, and poses no issues for re-entry.\n\nSunday August 12 (Flight day 5)\n\nThe crew carried out the focused inspection without any problems, and at 20:56 (UTC), the crews of Endeavour and Expedition 15 were notified that the SSPTS was working as expected, and the mission was officially extended to the planned 14-day mission. Commander Scott Kelly replied, \"That's great news, thanks\".\n\nIn the daily mission status briefing, Lead Flight Director Matt Abbott announced the official extension of the mission, that the SSPTS was working as planned, and they were pleased with the data gathered during the focused inspection on Sunday. Mission Management Team Chairman John Shannon confirmed the decision of the Mission Management Team to extend the mission to 14 days, and to add a fourth EVA, was unanimous. He noted that the addition of SSPTS will be a valuable new tool, providing not only extended missions, but also the ability to provide the space station with additional supplies of oxygen, water, and other resources.\n\nShannon reported on the focused inspection, confirming that good laser data and imagery was obtained, and they resolved several areas of interest, classifying them as of no concern. One area of interest was two adjacent thermal plates on the shuttle's underside that had a gouge that appeared to be deeper than would allow them to rule it out. NASA would use data from the focused inspection to model the area, and do thermal analysis of the area. They will use the data to mimic the damage with sample tiles at Johnson Space Center, and using a variety of testing methods, possible courses of action would then be evaluated. No decision would be made until all data had been received and reviewed.\n\nShannon did report that following STS-118, NASA will do a thorough review of the history of foam loss from the area of the external tank since STS-114, analysis and testing would be done, and any speculation as to a future course of action would not be made until all the information was available.\n\nMonday August 13 (Flight day 6)\n\nRick Mastracchio and Dave Williams completed the mission's second spacewalk, successfully achieving all of the scheduled activities. During the EVA, they removed a new CMG from Endeavours payload bay, and moved it to the Z1 truss, where they removed the failed CMG. After installing the new CMG, they placed the failed CMG on an external stowage platform, where it will remain until it is returned to Earth with mission STS-122. After initial testing on the ground, NASA reported the new CMG was functioning normally.\n\nDuring the EVA, Mastracchio reported an EVA suit alarm, indicating high levels of , but after reviewing all indicators and sensors, NASA confirmed it was an instrumentation issue, and the suit itself was fine. At the mission status briefing, NASA reported the suit would be used on future spacewalks, and the issue was not of any concern.\n\nDuring the Mission Management briefing, John Shannon discussed Endeavours heat shield and re-entry issues. He reported that after initial modeling they believe the majority of heating will be on the backside of the gouge, and not into the filler bar side, which was the preferable situation. He reiterated that it was a complicated aerodynamic shape, and they wanted to be sure the flow would concentrate in the back \"well\" of the hole. The engineers and analysts would continue to do additional flow modeling, after which they would take the data into the arc jet testing facility for additional analysis. The first preliminary arc jet tests would be performed Monday night.\n\nShannon reported a \"team four\" had been assembled, along with the operations and engineering teams, to assist in data analysis. The teams will look at options for repair if required, and make recommendations to the Mission Management Team after the analysis of tests and data. Shannon stated he had no doubt that if a repair was required, the crew could execute it without significant impact to the mission timeline. He reiterated that this was not a catastrophic damage situation, but simply a situation that they would prefer to fix if possible, similar to the OMS blanket issue during STS-117 in June 2007.\n\nThere are three different on-orbit repair techniques available to the crew. Both post-Columbia Return to Flight missions experimented with various repair materials and techniques, and the STS-118 crew has trained for those procedures.\n\nTuesday August 14 (Flight day 7)\n[[File:STS-118 ESP-3 on RMS.jpg|thumbnail|right|Backdropped by Earth, Endeavour'''s Canadarm moves the external stowage platform (ESP-3).]]\nThe Endeavour crew awoke on Tuesday to the voices of Tracy Caldwell's family singing happy birthday to her. The two crews successfully removed the ESP-3 from Endeavours payload bay, and installed it onto the P3 truss. They also continued with transfer activities, and several crew members took time out to have two Public Affairs events, one of them answering children's questions from the Discovery Center in Boise, Idaho. During an interview with CBS, Commander Kelly stated that he was not concerned about the tile damage, and would be comfortable with any decision NASA made, \"My understanding is this tile damage is not an issue of the safety of the crew... I'm not concerned with our safety.\" The main reason for fixing it, he noted, would be to assist with processing once the orbiter was back at the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, Kirk Shireman, Deputy International Space Station Program Manager, reported that the External Stowage Platform installation went well; the new CMG was working well, and handover of attitude control directly from the shuttle to the station was completed without problems. In addition, a new Russian computer was installed on the station, and testing of the system would be performed in late August. He also mentioned several of the experiments that were launched with STS-118, and reported all experiments were proceeding well. Shireman also noted that as of 15:17 UTC, the Zarya module of the station had orbited the Earth 50,000 times.\n\nJohn Shannon reported that the orbiter systems were in excellent shape, and had no issues. With regards to the remaining area of tile damage on the underside of the orbiter, Shannon reported that initial thermal analysis had been completed. Computational fluid dynamics testing at Ames Research Center had been done, and the preliminary results were  \"cautiously optimistic\". Testing at the arc jet facility would continue Tuesday night. Shannon stated they would go through complete EVA scenario testing at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, to help develop the EVA procedures if needed.\n\nWednesday August 15 (Flight day 8)\n\nRick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson began the third EVA of the mission at 14:37 UTC. During the EVA, they successfully relocated a CETA Cart, retrieved the P6 Transponder, relocated the S-band antenna from P6 to P1, and installed a new S-Band Baseband Signal Processor and Transponder on the P1 truss. During a routine glove inspection, Mastracchio noticed a possible tear on the thumb of his left glove. To be safe, NASA managers decided to end the spacewalk at 20:05, and examination and photography of the glove was performed during suit removal. The spacewalk accomplished all but one of the tasks (MISSE retrieval). On the station, the crewmembers continued with transfer activities.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, Joel Montalbano reported that the issue with Mastracchio's suit was never a danger to the suit integrity, and the decision to cut the EVA short was one of precaution. Extended photography was performed, and additional analysis will be completed prior to the fourth EVA. Montalbano reported that the fourth EVA would be no earlier than August 18, 2007.\n\nLead spacewalk officer Paul Boehm agreed that the EVA went well, the major objectives were completed, and he reiterated that at no time was Mastracchio's suit in any danger of leaking.\n\nEVA Office Manager Steve Doering reported on the details regarding the issue with Mastracchio's glove. The EVA inspection procedure was implemented following STS-116, when a cut was found on Robert Curbeam's glove following an EVA. The EVA suit comprises five layers of material, and the second layer, called vectran, is a high strength material resistant to tearing. Mastracchio's tear was into the vectran layer. Prior to the next EVA, video analysis will be done of the path Mastracchio took during the spacewalk in an attempt to discover where the tear may have occurred. An analysis of Mastracchio's glove during the previous two EVAs will also be performed.\n\nJohn Shannon reported that no decision had been made regarding the tile damage on the underside of the orbiter, but the fourth EVA was postponed to at least August 18, 2007. The management team would continue to analyze the potential risks of repair to the underside of the orbiter, as well as any other areas of risk. Shannon reported the results of the arc jet testing showed some erosion into the backside of the adjacent tile upon re-entry, but the erosion did not go through the entire layer of the tile. Preliminary results were encouraging, but additional testing would be performed on Wednesday night. Shannon reported that the final decision would most likely be made on Thursday. Shannon said \"I am cautiously optimistic that repairs will not be needed\".\n\nThursday August 16 (Flight day 9)\nThe station and shuttle crews continued transfer activities on flight day 9, as well as EVA preparations, which included TPS repair procedure review, in case NASA decided a repair was necessary.\n\nMission Specialists Barbara Morgan and Alvin Drew participated in an education event in the morning with students at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia. The event was hosted by Dr. June Scobee Rodgers, wife of Challengers commander, Dick Scobee, and Founding Chairman of the Challenger Center. Morgan and Drew also spoke to reporters from the Associated Press, Reuters and Idaho Public Television.\n\nDuring the interview with Reuters, Drew stated \"We've been talking to the engineers who have been analyzing this far more than we have in space, and they seem to feel that the biggest danger is more to just being able to re-use Endeavour once it gets back on the ground. They seem to be confident, and I trust their confidence that we can get home safely even with the divot that we have in the belly,\" Morgan added \"We have a lot of faith in the program, and we'll do what the engineers decide is the best thing for us to do. We have all confidence we're going to be able to do the right thing.\"\n\nAt 01:00 UTC, August 17, 2007, CAPCOM Shane Kimbrough notified commander Kelly that the Mission Management Team decided that no repair to the damaged tile on the underside of the orbiter would be required.\n\nDuring the Mission Management Team briefing, John Shannon announced the team's unanimous decision that an EVA to repair the damaged tile was not required, and the tile damage on the underside of the orbiter was not a threat to crew safety. However, the spacewalk to repair the damage could pose a variety of risks, and those risks weighed heavily into the final decision. He noted the arc jet tests actually showed a higher degree of damage than the orbiter would sustain during re-entry, so the tests were helpful in showing the worst \"possible\" damage, and still did not damage the tile during testing enough to warrant repair.\n\nShannon did note that the JSC Engineering Independent Group advised NASA managers that repairing the damage on-orbit could assist with mission turn-around time once the orbiter was on the ground. Shannon noted that the risks associated with in-flight repair outweighed the possible delay in processing the orbiter following the mission. He stated that normal turn-around time would not be compromised, as most orbiters have at least 60 tiles replaced after each mission, so the situation would not be any different from past missions.\n\nWhen pressed during the briefing by a reporter as to the chance of shuttle or crew loss, Shannon reported \"I am 100 percent comfortable that the work that has been done, has accurately characterized the damage, and that we will have a very successful re-entry\". He stated that over 200 people were involved in the decision, representing over 30 organizations, including NASA Ames Research Center, NASA's Langley Research Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, KSC, JSC, and that all the groups combined came to the same decision.\n\nShannon reported that the glove issue encountered during EVA three had been discussed, and stated that analysis would be continued, in advance of EVA four on Saturday. The crew does have a spare set of gloves, if needed.\n\nShannon reported on a micro-meteoroid debris strike discovered on the commander's window of the orbiter, which was 1 millimeter in depth. Shannon noted that it was consistent with previous damage sustained on past missions. Analysis would be conducted regarding this issue, using photographs sent down by the crew early Thursday morning.\n\nThe final item discussed was Hurricane Dean, which was heading towards the Caribbean Sea, and projected to move into the Gulf of Mexico. Contingency procedures and plans were in place, but Shannon did not anticipate it would affect the mission's timeline at all.\n\nFriday August 17 (Flight day 10)\nThe station and shuttle crews had a relatively quiet day on flight day 10, continuing transfer operations, and doing some troubleshooting on a communication system between the shuttle and station. The two crews took some time out to have a joint news conference with US and Canadian news agencies, and took the official combined crew portrait. When asked by reporters on the ground whether the crew agreed with NASA's decision to return without repairing the damage to Endeavour's underside, Commander Kelly replied, \"We agree absolutely 100 percent with the decision to not repair the damage.\"\n\nDuring the mission status briefing, Lead Flight Director Matt Abbott discussed the ongoing preparations and plans with regards to Hurricane Dean, and reported NASA was watching the storm's track closely. If required, contingency plans are available. While the mission's timeline could be changed if required, no decision was made, and the mission was proceeding as planned.\n\nDeputy ISS Program Manager Kirk Shireman reported the S-Band system relocated during the third EVA was working well, and the SSPTS provided enough oxygen to be able to completely fill all reserves on the station. Shireman commented that transfer operations were approximately 75% complete.\n\nEVA Office Manager Steve Doering reported on the decision to proceed with Saturday's EVA. The team analyzed the video downlinked from the third EVA, and the review showed no evidence of any specific event that would indicate a sharp edge, or excessive wear. A review of the manufacturing of the gloves was done, and no concerns were identified. The paths taken by astronauts during spacewalks were reviewed, identifying common paths between the third EVA, and Saturday's planned EVA, and the crew was notified of the common locations, to identify areas where additional glove inspections would be performed on Saturday. Overall, the final EVA would be less \"hand-intensive\" than the previous spacewalks, and the conclusion following the analysis was that Saturday's EVA would go ahead as planned.\n\nSaturday August 18 (Flight day 11)\n\nNASA Managers decided overnight to shorten the fourth EVA by two hours as a precaution due to Hurricane Dean's continued path into the Gulf of Mexico. The EVA duration was five hours and 2 minutes, with a total EVA time of 23 hours and 15 minutes for the mission. The EVA accomplished three primary objectives, and one get-ahead task. Two tasks were deferred: plans to tie down debris shields on the Destiny lab, and relocation of a tool box. During the spacewalk, Williams and Anderson got a good look at Hurricane Dean, and were both awed at the sight. \"Holy smoke\" was Anderon's initial comment. \"Man, that's impressive\", Williams replied. Anderson added \"They're only impressive when they're not coming towards you.\" Transfer activities were completed ahead of schedule, and both crews worked hard to get everything transferred back to Endeavour after the spacewalk.\n\nDave Williams set two records during his third EVA; He is the Canadian with the most spacewalks (3); and he passed Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield in total EVA time. Williams ended Saturday's EVA with a total of 17 hours, 47 minutes of extravehicular time.\n\nDuring the mission status briefing, Launch Integration Manager LeRoy Cain reported that the Mission Management Team decided to take extra precautions in preparation for the storm, and STS-118 would be cut short a day. In the event of a hurricane evacuation in Houston, an emergency command center would need to be set up. While it was a contingency set in place for years, NASA would prefer to avoid that situation. To that end, Cain reported the EVA was shortened, and the hatch closure would be done Saturday evening, rather than Sunday as planned. Undocking would be at 11:57 UTC Sunday, with the first KSC Landing opportunity on August 21, 2007.\n\nAt 19:46, a short farewell ceremony was performed, followed by hatch closure at 20:10 UTC. Tuesday's tentative KSC landing time would be 12:32 pm EST. (16:30 UTC)\n\nSunday August 19 (Flight day 12)Endeavour successfully undocked from the International Space Station at 11:56 UTC. Saturday, NASA managers decided the station fly-around that is normally performed following each mission would not be conducted in order to give the Shuttle crew more free time during flight day 12. After several long work days, the Mission Control team felt the crew needed some downtime before the landing process began.\n\nAfter undocking, two 4-second firings of the Reaction Control System were performed, in order to distance Endeavour from the station and move to a position above it. There, the crew deployed the robotic arm, beginning Late Inspection of the reinforced carbon-carbon tiles on the nose cap and wing leading edges.\n\nAt the mission status briefing, Matt Abbott reported the undocking was \"flawless\", and the late inspection was completed successfully. Monday would be a standard pre-landing day, with checkout of the various systems on Endeavour, as well as an educational media event. Entry Flight Director Steve Stich and the entry team will take over mission duties tonight, in preparation for Tuesday's landing.\n\nJohn Shannon reported the mission management team meeting went well. The landing plan was reviewed, and all teams reported \"go\" for landing on Tuesday. The latest track for Hurricane Dean was favorable for the Houston area; the storm seemed to be swinging farther south than originally expected. NASA managers were optimistic that contingency plans would not be needed. Final decisions regarding alternate plans would not be made until Monday, but Shannon noted that White Sands Space Harbor landing facility would be removed as an alternate site. Edwards Air Force Base, and Kennedy Shuttle Landing Facility would be the two sites evaluated on Monday.\n\nMonday August 20 (Flight day 13)\nOn Monday, with the shuttle approximately  behind the International Space Station, the crew of Endeavour performed a variety of check-out tests in preparation for entry, configured the Spacehab module for entry, and did some last minute stowage. Kelly and Hobaugh worked with the shuttle landing simulator on board, practicing the anticipated landing tracks. Kelly, Williams and Morgan took some time out to talk to students at the Canadian school, La Ronge, in Saskatchewan.\n\nDuring the mission status briefing, Entry Flight Director Steve Stich reported the track of Hurricane Dean would not require the activation of contingency plans, and the forecast looked favorable for a Tuesday landing at Kennedy Shuttle Landing Facility. There were also two opportunities for a Florida landing, with the first opportunity beginning with a deorbit burn at 15:25 UTC, and landing at 16:32 UTC. The second opportunity would call for a deorbit burn at 17:00 UTC, with landing at 18:16 UTC. Weather was not expected to interfere with landing, with a forecast of high clouds, but no inclement weather. If the second landing opportunity was taken, the shuttle would fly directly over Hurricane Dean, although it would be well above any effects of the storm. NASA did plan to call up Edwards Air Force Base as the backup site, which had two opportunities on Tuesday, but the plan was to attempt a KSC landing, and if both opportunities were waved off, NASA would decide whether to wait a day, and try for a Wednesday landing at KSC. If Wednesday opportunities at Florida were waved off due to weather, a landing at Edwards Air Force Base would be attempted.\n\nTuesday August 21 (Flight day 14, Landing)\n\nThe crew of Endeavour went right to work after waking up on Tuesday, completing the close-out of the Spacehab module, and getting into the deorbit preparations timeline. They closed payload bay doors, transitioned the vehicle computers to landing software mode and donned their reentry suits. At 14:30 UTC, the crew was given the \"go\" to begin fluid loading. This was done to assist with the crew's ability to adjust to gravity, and to prevent hypotension after landing. At 12:30 UTC, the Space Flight Meteorology Group reported to Entry Team Flight Director Steve Stich that the weather forecast was a \"go\". The weather at Kennedy Space Center showed only scattered showers moving away from the landing facility, and cross winds were not expected to be a problem. At 15:08 UTC, the crew was given a \"go\" for the deorbit burn, and the auxiliary power units were started at 15:20 UTC. The 4-minute engine burn was successfully completed at 15:28 UTC, slowing Endeavour by approximately  and adjusting the orbiter's trajectory correctly for landing.\n\nRadar acquisition of Endeavour through MILA happened at 16:19 UTC. At 16:20 UTC, the shuttle had passed the area of peak heating, with no issues reported on board. Main landing gear touchdown occurred at 16:32:16 UTC with nose gear touchdown at 16:32:29 UTC. The orbiter came to a complete stop at 16:33:20 UTC. Upon wheel stop, CAPCOM Christopher Ferguson told the crew, \"Congratulations, you've given a new meaning to the term 'higher education.'\"\n\nInitial post-landing inspection of the orbiter showed very little additional damage to the thermal tiles affected by the foam strike during launch. Barbara Morgan did not exit the crew transport vehicle with the rest of the crew; she remained on board the vehicle to receive additional medical tests, and would return to the Astronaut Crew Quarters in that vehicle. The remaining six crew members briefly examined the orbiter, doing the traditional post-flight \"walkaround\", posed for photos, and then returned to the crew quarters in the Astrovan.\n\nDuring the post-landing briefing, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin reported that the International Space Station was approximately 60% completed following STS-118. Griffin also stressed the importance of space exploration, and added that the damaged tile on the underside of the orbiter did very well during re-entry.\n\nAssociate Administrator for Spaceflight Operations William H. Gerstenmaier reported the damage was actually less than what the arc jet testing produced, a situation that NASA anticipated, and managers had earlier stressed that arc jets show \"worst possible\" damage. Launch Director Mike Leinbach stressed how pleased he was with the mission, and with the condition of the vehicle following re-entry. He stated it was \"one of the cleanest vehicles the managers have seen since the Return to Flight policies were implemented, if not the cleanest.\"\n\nAt the end of the briefing, Griffin commented to the media who focused on Barbara Morgan being the first \"teacher in space\", that Morgan was not technically a \"teacher in space\", nor was she an \"educator astronaut\". He stated she was accepted as a mission specialist, before the new class of mission specialist educators were selected in 2004, and NASA considers her to be a mission specialist, who was once a teacher. However, NASA does refer to Morgan as a mission specialist educator in a number of interviews, so the terms seem to be interchangeable to most, if not to Griffin.\n\nDuring the post-landing crew press conference, Kelly was asked \"Did the tile damage enter your mind at all during re-entry, and what did you think about it once you got a look during the walkaround?\" Kelly's reply was, \"I thought about it, but only because I knew I'd be asked about it. I didn't worry about it at all. I was underwhelmed by it.\"\n\nExtra-vehicular activity \n\nWake-up calls\nNASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by their family, and usually has special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.\n\n Contingency mission\nSTS-322 was the designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support mission which would have been launched in the event Endeavour'' had become disabled during STS-118. It would have been a modified version of the STS-120 mission, which would have involved the launch date being brought forward. If it had been needed, it would have been launched no earlier than September 22, 2007. The crew for this mission would have been a four-person subset of the full STS-120 crew.\n\nMedia\n\nSee also\n\n 2007 in spaceflight\n List of human spaceflights\n List of International Space Station spacewalks\n List of Space Shuttle missions\n Lists of spacewalks and moonwalks\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n STS-118 mission summary\n NASA Space Shuttle News\n STS-118 Video Highlights \n Behind the scenes at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Lab\n NASAspaceflight.com STS 118 forum\n EVA Hazards due to Inspection and Repair\n Discovery Center of Idaho\n\nSpace Shuttle missions\nSpacecraft launched in 2007\nSpacecraft which reentered in 2007\nArticles containing video clips",

        "text":"Speed Grapher (stylized as SPEED GRAPHER) is a 2005 anime series produced by Gonzo. The series ran for 24 episodes from April to October 2005 on TV Asahi. It tells the story of former war photographer, Tatsumi Saiga and his quest to save Kagura Tennōzu from Chōji Suitengu and the members of a fetish club, the Roppongi Club. In 2006, the series was licensed for release in North America by Funimation and aired on the Independent Film Channel between March 7 and August 15, 2008.\n\nThe series was adapted into a manga by Tomozo. Originally serialized by MediaWorks in Monthly Dengeki Comic GAO!, it was released to three tankōbon between September 2005 and September 2006. The manga series was then licensed to Chuang Yi, who released the three volumes in English and Chinese in Singapore, and later to Tokyopop, who released the first two volumes in North America in September and December 2008. A light novel was also created and was written by Minoru Niki. It was published by Hayakawa Publishing and released on July 21, 2005.\n\nPlot\n\nSpeed Grapher follows the exploits of former war photographer Tatsumi Saiga, who investigates a secret fetish club for the ultra-wealthy called the Roppongi Club. He tries to photograph the club's \"goddess\", a 15-year-old, exploited girl named Kagura, but is discovered. As he is about to be killed, Kagura kisses him, granting him the ability to destroy anything he photographs. Saiga soon discovers that Kagura's body fluids, like her saliva, in combination with a certain \"virus\", can give people bizarre abilities relating to their secret desires, fetishes, and obsessions. Club members strive for the honor of becoming \"gifted\" via Kagura's power. Saiga soon becomes entangled in this secret underground society and the powerful and corrupt Tennōzu Group mega-corporation that operates it. He attempts to free Kagura, a move that puts the two of them on the run from the Tennōzu Group and blood-thirsty members of the club with bizarre and often horrifying special powers.\n\nSaiga and Suitengu engage in a game of cat and mouse; Saiga and Kagura manage to evade capture several times before Suitengu himself attacks Saiga, severely injuring him, and takes Kagura captive. To take over Tennōzu Group, Suitengu murders its president, Shinsen Tennōzu, who also is Kagura's mother. Kagura inherits the group, so Suitengu attempts to marry her to take legal control of it. Saiga, having recovered from his wounds, interrupts the wedding and rescues Kagura. Together, they attempt to leave Japan but are enticed back by the prospect of defeating Suitengu once and for all.\n\nThe plan, however, ends up being a trap set up by Prime Minister Kamiya, Seiji Ochiai and other Cabinet members as a way to control Suitengu and take control over the club. But, Suitengu knew of their betrayal, and after trapping all the Cabinet members, the police superintendent and other members of government inside the club, he went to Kamiya's mansion to exact his revenge against him for having ruined his life and that of his family in the past. After brutally killing him, he then took away Kagura from Saiga by promising not to kill Saiga if Kagura comes with him willingly. Saiga and his policewoman friend Hibari Ginza make one final attack on Suitengu's stronghold - the main building of Tennōzu Group. In addition, a group of politicians from around the world fire missiles at Tokyo to kill Suitengu. Saiga and Suitengu battle, but Saiga is unable to defeat Suitengu before going blind from overusing his power. Suitengu spares Saiga's life, and, in a final act of defiance, self-destructs the Tennōzu building, killing all the members of the club and destroying all the money he gathered, before dying in the explosion. The world collapses into a financial crisis, but Saiga and Kagura finally reunite five years later, no longer under threat of attack.\n\nProduction\nSpeed Grapher was aimed at a mature audience to \"stimulate the audience at an intellectual level\", according to director Kunihisa Sugishima. The story was influenced by the Japanese economic scenario in which there were several cases of suicides. He noted these cases must have been caused by the fact that in our society \"financial fortune is equated with success and is expected to lead to happiness\". He described Saiga as someone who opposes this system and Kagura as someone trapped on it. Gonzo opted to use little computer graphics and to create hand-drawn illustrations painted by computer for both the foreground and the background. In Sugishima's words: \"Because we wanted Speed Grapher to stand out because of its story, we chose not to use any special visual effects.\"\n\nMedia\n\nAnime\n\nThe episodes of Speed Grapher are directed by Kunihisa Sugishima, animated by Gonzo, and produced by TV Asahi. They initially aired on TV Asahi between April 8, 2005, and September 30, 2005, in Japan. It was then released to twelve DVD compilations, each containing two episodes, between July 2005 and June 2006 by Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nThe North American adaptation was licensed to Funimation, who released it to DVD and on iTunes. The six DVD compilations, containing four episodes each, were released to Region 1 between July 2006 and March 2007. Several \"Limited Edition\" DVDs were also released on the same dates as the regular DVDs. On March 11, 2008, a box set was released. Speed Grapher aired on the Independent Film Channel between March 7 and August 15, 2008. On September 28, 2006, Madman Entertainment revealed that it had received a license to distribute Speed Grapher to Australia and New Zealand. Madman released the first DVD volume with a collector's box on October 11, 2006. A box release, with all six DVD compilations, was released on March 19, 2008. In the United Kingdom, Speed Grapher was licensed to MVM Films, who released six DVD compilations between April 16, 2007, and February 4, 2008. Speed Grapher was also aired internationally by Animax. In Latin America, Animax aired the series in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico. Future showings are also planned in Asia.\n\nManga\nBased directly on the anime, a manga series, also entitled Speed Grapher, was released in Japan by MediaWorks and was originally serialized in Monthly Dengeki Comic GAO!. Illustrated by Tomozo, the series was collected into three tankōbon, which were released between September 2005 and September 2006.\n\nThe series was licensed to Chuang Yi in Singapore, who released all three volumes of the manga in English on December 11, 2007, July 22, 2008, and November 2009 respectively. Chuang Yi also released the series in Chinese. The Speed Grapher manga received another English release by Tokyopop in North America, who released the first two volumes on September 16, 2008, and December 2, 2008, respectively. The third volume was set to be released on March 10, 2009, but was cancelled shortly beforehand. In Germany, the manga was licensed to Carlson Comics, who released all three volumes.\n\nLight novel\nA light novel version of Speed Grapher, written by Minoru Niki, was also released. Hayakawa Publishing released it on July 21, 2005. The novel was also licensed to Tokyopop in North America and was set to be released on November 11, 2008, but was cancelled alongside volume three of the manga.\n\nMusic\nA drama CD was released in Japan on September 22, 2005, by King Records. In addition, two soundtracks were released as bonus CDs accompanying the release of the second and the sixth DVD volume in August 2005 and February 2006, respectively. They include score music composed by Shinkichi Mitsumune, and the opening theme and the two ending themes.\n\nReception\nSpeed Grapher received mixed reviews from critics. Zac Bertschy and Theron Martin of Anime News Network both found the animation to be sub-par when compared to other Gonzo releases. In addition, Zac found the storyline to be \"totally silly\" and strange though it was possibly very entertaining because of its uniqueness. Theron found that later episodes felt \"more natural\" and cited the characters to be part of this improvement, though the animation was \"still second-class (at best).\" Compared to the Japanese release, Theron Martin greatly preferred the English dubs, noting that \"the English dialogue has more punch and better flow than the drier and sometimes awkwardly-worded Japanese.\" Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Weekly found Speed Grapher to have a \"rich feel that's mirrored in the lovely visuals\" and a complicated storyline. She also commented that \"Its dry, serious central plotline is also clearly aimed at viewers who value sophisticated, drawn-out serial stories over instant gratification.\" D. F. Smith of IGN disliked the storyline, though for different reasons. He felt that the series was \"trying way too hard to push the content envelope\" and that the characters were not likable. However, in contrast to the Anime News Network reviewers, he found the art and animation to be a \"first-rate job.\" The anime was chosen as the fifth best DVD release of the year by DVD Talk's staff. They wrote, \"the twists here were enough to make the series unique with a decidedly adult approach some may find discomforting but you will be glued to the edge of your seat as the action packed series provides some of the best intrigue of the year\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official English Site\n \n\n2005 manga\n2005 Japanese novels\n2005 Japanese television series endings\nAnime with original screenplays\nDengeki Comic Gao!\nDystopian anime and manga \nFunimation\nGonzo (company)\nLight novels\nPsychological anime and manga\nShōnen manga\nSupernatural anime and manga\nSuspense anime and manga",

Seeking out multiple opinions can help you by learning more about your options,  seeing different outlooks from people  helping you make better choices.  Asking for help is never a bad thing, it helps you be more confident on your final decision.\n Each person's opinion is different and asking multiple people can allow you to get a variety of responses on that topic. Different opinions can easily change your point of view. Some people can be more passionate with their opinions. That all matters on the person, some may give you a one word answer while others may go on and on. The more people you ask, the more ideas you get for your choice. This could be overwhelming which is why you want to take your time on understanding the different aspects of your choices and what people have said. There is no minimum or maximum of people you may want to ask, it's all up to you, but the more the merrier. People have more knowledge on certain things and they may know a lot about it. This may help you become more comfortable with your choices, and hearing it through a conversation could be more beneficial than researching about it. It depends on what decision you're trying to make but, people may have a first hand background or experience with it and you may never know if you didn't ask. You have a lot of knowledge in things you don't even realize. Some things are tucked away deep inside your brain. Thinking more into a certain thing can help wake up that part of your mind more. In the end, people know more than you might realize.\n More opinions can help you have less stress in the end. Opinions can teach you a lesson of how you may think next time a problem comes up. It could end with being an easy good decision or a long thought good decision. You'll end up more certain. Whenever you are put up with a task, you want to make sure your decision is going to be the best for everyone, not just yourself. You can gain a stronger personal opinion that can back you up in the future. You may disagree with everyone or you may agree with everyone, gaining the skill to agree and disagree is a strong thing to do! Stress is common and asking for people's opinions may just lower the amount you have.  Asking others for their opinion is a easy way to make better choices. Whether its learning something new, or having stronger mental health, asking is benefical in every way. ",

        "text":"4th year medical student here.\n\nMatch day, or simply \"the match,\" is the giant, computerized, medical school version of picking kickball teams in grade school. There are only so many teams, and so many positions, and lots of kids want to play, so you pick teams. Not everyone will make it.\n\n >  Does everyone get a residency?\n\nNo. This year there where 30,000 residency slots, and 45,000 applicants. Meaning 15,000 people where very disappointed this week. What do those who don't match do? Well it's not match day, it's match week, as everyone found out Monday *IF* they matched or not, but they didn't know where yet. For those Monday who didn't match, they enter a second phase called the SOAP or the scramble. They and their schools try to get the unmatched students into open residency slots. The slots open for the SOAP aren't the best slots, or else they would have been filled, and those who didn't match on Monday either weren't the best students (low GPA, low board scores) or tried to match into a competitive residency slot and got beat out. A few thousand who didn't match initially will find a residency in the SOAP, but probably not their 1st choice specialty and definitely not their 1st choice location. The thousands of students today without a residency match will have to do something else. Many go into clinical research, some go into consulting. Many retry the board exams to get higher scores and become more competitive, as many retry in next year's match. \n\n >  Why are some people dressed in costumes?\n\nCause people be cray. No really tough, medical school is hard. Very hard. And it's long. 4 years of the toughest tests, more info to learn than you could ever be capable of learning, rotation after rotation of 14 hour days, weekend call, being the FNG over and over again. Med school sucks. It isn't enough to simply do the work, you have to rise above it, find a motivation to get through the day to day bullshit. You work really hard to first just survive the deluge of information, then find a specialty you might like, then work SUPER hard to make connections in that specialty, audition rotations like a rock star, then get a board score that wont price you out of your specialty, then...whew it's exausting. Right now I've put in 4 years of the hardest work of my life trying to match into the specialty I want, but also match at the location I want. It sucked, worth it, but it sucked. \n\nSo year after all that shit, Match day is a party, a rite of passage for doctors, a tradition we've all done. It's the culmination of 4 years of hard work. Yeah graduation is where you get your diploma, but the match is where you get your future. So yeah, med students, already a pretty work hard, party hard group, kinda do a  blow out celebration. Residency is gonna suck, you are more over worked and under slept than in med school, so we tend to get our party on, costumes and all, out late in 4th year. \n\n >  So do you not need to apply to residencies?\n\nYes, if you want to be a practicing clinician. In order to be the most basic level of practicing doctor, the general practitioner, or GP, you must have completed at least one year of post-graduate residency training at an accredited residency. This is your PGY1 or intern year, and if you want to see patients and write scripts, it's legally the bare minimum you have to do. \n\nThe vast majority of doctors go for longer residencies so they can become board certified in specialties. Most, if not all, hospitals, practice groups, and insurance companies will not recognize your right to practice without first attaining the relevant board certifications and specialty residency graduation. That Family Practice group isn't gonna hire you if you haven't don't a full 3 year FM residency. No hospital would credential you to use their OR if you weren't a board certified surgeon. Residencies (including that intern year) can range from 3 years to 7 years. Some specialties require you do one of those, one and done, intern year only residencies and then rematch to finish the remaining 3-4 years, like radiology and dermatology. Even further specialized training occurs in what are known as fellowships, 1-3 years of additional training after graduating residencies, they have their own match too.",

        "text":"Summary:\nThe paper proposes to use Model-RIP, a simple concept from compressed sensing community, to theoretically describe a invertibility of a single convolution + max-pool operation (i.e., without non-linear activation function) assuming that the convolution filters are drawn from random Gaussian distribution. In the high level, they attempted to show that convolution weights consisting of random filters form a roughly orthogonal matrix, hence its transpose times the activation roughly reconstruct the input. Empirically, this submission tries to verify the model-RIP property of learned CNN filters by computing the norm ratio between the activation and the weight transpose multiplying the activation, and verify the reconstruction bounds by computing the relative errors between the input and the reconstructed input through the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Qualitatively, they also try to invert the activation to the previous layer output through the same algorithm then followed up by a learned decoder to reconstruct the raw input.\n\n\nHowever, there are many flaws in their assumptions but little useful consequence from enforcing CNNs to their mathematical model. The most evident flaws in their theorems are (1) the weight matrix of learned CNNs does not meet their model-RIP assumption (i.e., low coherence) and (2) even without the first flaw, their reconstruction bound doesn’t hold analytically with ReLU non-linearity: RIP can only bound the norm of the transposed weights times the activation (see Eq. 1) instead of providing enough conditions for a metric-preserving property between input space and activation space [3] since ReLU zeroes out the negative activations, i.e., the activation can be arbitrarily close to zero. Furthermore, the presentations of their experimental results are very misleading and self-contradicting: a pre-trained decoder with switch units is responsible for most of the reconstruction and they only applied their proposed recon algorithm on one layer; the “relative error” does not give reasonable measurement of the reconstruction property, especially in the pixel space; the norm ratio ||W^Tc||\/||c|| is also an inappropriate measurement for model-RIP condition, not to mention the discrepancy between the presented norm ratio and the learned filter’s coherence level (if ||W^Tc||\/||c|| is close to 1, coherence should be close to 0, but it is actually much larger than 0).  \n\n\n[1] W.

        "text":" Spitting needs to be done as cleanly as possible to be courteous to others who are around. It's typical to need to spit when you're sick with a cold, using tobacco, or are working physically.\n\n\nNever spit indoors, unless you're using a receptacle of some kind. In the case that you are using a receptacle, as in wine tasting or tobacco chewing, it's important that you keep your receptacle concealed. Nobody wants to sit next to your empty water bottle filled with brown tobacco juice at the library. Put it away.\nDon't make a habit of spitting just to spit, even if you're outdoors. If you're sick, or have a serious need, that's the only time you should be spitting in a courteous way.;\n, There's no way around it: spitting is gross. To help make it less gross, it helps to avoid spitting in places where people will be able to see it. If you're indoors, spit into the toilet and flush it. If you're outdoors, spit into a hanky and put it away. If you're tasting or chewing, spit into a proper receptacle, like a bottle or a can, then dispose of it.\n\n\nSometimes, when you're outside working, it's just not possible or practical to spit into a hanky. If this is the case, walk a few paces away from where you're working and spit off the beaten path. If it's particularly gross, kick some dirt over it for good measure.\n\n, Whether you're indoors or outdoors, it's rude to spit on the ground where someone might be walking and risk stepping on it. Don't do it, and if you're going to spit on the ground at all make sure it's out of the way.\n\n\nIf you're playing sports and spit on the field, it's sometimes common courtesy to stamp it into the grass so your gross loogie isn't sitting at the 50 yard line for everyone to fall in.\n\n, Spitting is a social taboo and many others look on it as a disgusting habit. If you must spit, do it quickly, quietly, and get it over with. Drawing attention to yourself while you're spitting is rude in most cultures. Try to do it quietly and quickly, without a lot of preamble or fuss.\n\n, You don't want to make a mess, so it's important to do most of the work before you spit. Gather the liquid or the saliva you're going to spit on top of your tongue to spit it out. Keep your cheeks in tight to your teeth to keep things in one place.\n\n, Your lips need to be rounded to avoid spritzing your spit or experiencing any gross blowback. Nobody wants reverse fire. To keep it grouped and to keep your spit clean, round your lips as you prepare. Keep your cheeks caved and your lips tight.\n\n, No drooling. Get it all out at once. Take a breath and quickly blow the spit out from your mouth as quickly as possible. It should stay together if you've done it properly.\n\n, If you want to spit for distance, you need to arch your neck and put your back into it. As you snap forward, blow your spit out and see how far it goes. Be very careful with your aim.\n\n\nGenerally, it's best to spit as close as possible to the ground to avoid making it gross. Bend over at the waist over your receptacle and spit.\n\n, In some cultures and especially in baseball, it's common to spit on the ground, close to someone's feet, when you want to insult them. This is a common way of expressing disgust.\n\n\nThis is always insulting. Because of this, it can also be provocative and confrontational, which could lead to an escalation in a tense situation. Be very careful if you ever attempt to do this.\n\n, It's a common trope in hyper-masculine television shows that two men will spit on their hand before shaking to \"seal a deal,\" but this is purely a product of pop culture, not a common tradition in any culture.If you've just bought a house and want to seal the deal with the realtor, just shake hands in the regular way. No spitting necessary.\n\n, To avoid consuming too much alcohol during a wine tasting, it's traditional to spit the wine out into a bucket after tasting each different variety. Buckets will often be provided at professional tasting events, but they may not be. If you'd rather spit, make sure you locate a receptacle before taking wine into your mouth and never just spit it onto the ground.\n\n\nIf you're only going to be tasting a few varieties, it's always perfectly ok to swallow the wine instead. Just get a designated driver.\n\n, It's common practice to keep the sidewalk and other surfaces free of tobacco stains by spitting into a jar, bottle, or receptacle that you keep on your person, ideally out of sight. Even if you're going to be outside, it's a good idea to spit tobacco into a receptacle.\n\n\nOld-style spittoons were first introduced to help control the spread of tuberculosis and other communicable disease spread by contact with bodily fluids. Spittoons are still common in some public buildings, including the United States Senate., In Northern India and some other regions, it's thought that spitting on the ground can help to ward off the possibility of bad omens. If you're a superstitious person and find a black cat crossing your path, a bird flying into your house, or you find yourself walking under a ladder, consider spitting courteously and quietly. It's good luck.\n\n",

        "text":"So iOS and Android's ecosystems are significantly different. not just at the programming level, but even with how code is organized, what libraries are available, etc. In a company somewhere between 20-30 programmers, we had maybe 3-5 who were switch hitters between the two. Most were specialists in one language, and then further specialized with one thing (algorithm, UI, game theory, etc.)\n\nFurthermore, with iOS, you are designing with fewer issues of backwards\/hardware compatibility. You program for the latest iOS, and know that it should cover at least a few years worth of hardware. You then only pick up the hardware you need to test with.\n\nWith Android, the hardware can be cheaper, but there is a *lot* of issues due to the decentralized nature of both the OS and the hardware. What works on a Galaxy S3\/S4 might cause crashing on an HTC because of some weird custom launcher shit. Most of our QA with android phones involved figuring out why one particular popular model had issues where none of the other ones did.\n\nThat's not to rag on Android, but from a dev point of view, it could be challenging. That's not to say iOS didn't have its own issues - constant changes to the iOS libraries caused problems for us in general, and every time a new version of XCode came out a bunch of shit would break. At least with Android it was just Java, so the worst you had to deal with were new libraries. \n\nThere is also marketing - if you are making Game A, you have to decide where your customers are. If there are 100x games like Game A on the iOS store, but none in Androidland, then Android might be the better option since you can capture that market share. At the same time, iOS is still iOS - even if Android is making solid gains, from a marketing perspective having an iOS game is almost your default position. \n\nNow, to answer your question: code from one language doesn't just translate to another. Code from one OS doesn't just translate to another.\n\nOn iOS, you would design your code around Objective C, using the iOS libraries for drawing and graphics work. On Android, its all Java, and you use a *completely different set of libraries*. Hell, even the way that the UI is designed is different. In iOS you use Views and View Controllers. In Android you have activities and intents. They don't function exactly the same way, so there isn't a 1-to-1 translation.\n\nI've seen apps designed side by side between iOS and Android - not even the wireframes are the same. The only similarities are in the concept and how it should work - everything else, from the way the UI is designed and interacted with, down to the code, is completely different.",

The teachers could do weekly check ups and see how the students doing with their projects and to see if some students are even doing them or answer any questions the students may have about the project that was given. Students should also be able to get in contact with the teacher just in case they have any concerns or questions about the project  I think this will also be good for students so there brain could stay refresh while they out of school. Now, personally if I was in that predicament I would want my teacher to give me an topic or a subject on what my project should be about. If I try and do it on my own I over think and I get frustrated and give up and would not get it done, and i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one like this. From a child's perspective we would't want any projects during the summer time and if we was to get it we would want the easy way out like letting our teacher design the projects. Teachers are like our boosters for instance, if were completely lost on what to do or how to do something and we ask our teachers for help. They starting breaking stuff down to your understanding now you have more knowledge and understand what your suppose to do a little better.  Doing these projects could actually be fun. You can have fun and learn at the same time  I feel as though the summer projects should be teacher designed.  It would help students and more students will most likely do the project because of the teacher help. It will also be more easier for us students to ask questions and get help than to give up and stress themselves out about it. Giving summer projects will be beneficial and fun but only if it's teacher designed and not students",

        "text":" Warnings that are issued to an employee are generally issued following a certain progression or escalation. By sticking to the progression you can help the employee understand exactly what level of discipline they are currently receiving and just how serious the issue is. Review the following progression of employee warnings to learn if it is time for a written warning:Verbal warning\nWritten warning\nFinal written warning\nTermination of the employee.;\n, Before you issue the written warning to an employee you will want to consult your organization's disciplinary code. Make sure that the code agrees with your decision to issue a written warning. Match the severity of the issue to the disciplinary code that your organization uses before you submit your written warning.Some issues may not be very serious or are a first time occurrence with that employee. These may require a simple verbal warning.\nOther issues may be quite serious and could warrant a written warning, bypassing the verbal warning. These might include theft or threats of violence.\n\n, Before you create a written warning you will need to collect all the relevant information regarding the employee and the issue at hand. Collecting this information will allow you to judge if the written warning is appropriate as well as allow you to write a detailed and effective warning.\n\n\nLearn the dates and times of any employee infractions.\nDetail any conversations or previous verbal warnings about this issue.\nCollect old documents which the employee signed, documenting their acceptance to company terms and illustrating their violation of them.\n\n, Before you complete and issue your written warning you will want to speak privately with the employee in question. This meeting will allow you to further understand the situation and accurately judge if the next step is to issue a written warning to the employee.The conversation may reveal that the issue was a misunderstanding and no further action is needed.\nYou may be able to collect more information about the incident, allowing you to better issue your written warning should it be necessary.\n\n, In larger organizations it may be unclear as to who should be the one to deliver the written warning, especially if the employee has more than one supervisor or manager. Make sure that it is company policy that you are the one required to write or deliver the warning to the employee.Generally, the direct supervisor will issue the letter.\nIn some cases, the decision to issue the written warning may be decided by a group meeting.\n\n, Although requirements may vary amongst organizations, there are some common elements that you will want to include in your written warning. Review the following points of information to build an informative and effective written warning:Include the names of any parties involved.\nThe nature of the offense.\nThe date and time the offense occurred.\nDetails of the warning and the time period involved in the warning.\nInstructions for the employee regarding how to remedy the situation.\nConsequences of this infraction as well as the consequences of future issues.\n\n, When you are writing your warning you will need to be as specific and detailed as possible. Including clear and concise details in your warning will help convey the exact issue at hand and allow your employee to better make corrections and avoid further offenses in the future.\n\n\nInclude clear statements that describe the issue at hand. For example \"On June 23rd, you were reported as having been involved in a physical altercation with another employee\".\nWarnings should make clear what will happen if the employee's behavior is not corrected. For example \"If another infraction occurs, we will issue only one final warning before termination.\"\n\n, Although the warning is written, you won't be sending it through company mail or email. Delivering a written warning will need to be done in person, during a private meeting with the employee in question. This will allow for direct conversation between both parties and a clear communication of the issue at hand.Make the meeting for the earliest date available.\nGive some positive feedback as well. Don't just focus on the negative during the meeting.\n\n, Once you have written the warning and delivered it to the employee, you will want to make sure that the employee understands the warning. Discuss the terms of the warning, the duration it will last, why they are receiving it and how they can work to correct their course of action in the future.\n\n\nMost written warnings will have a place for signatures. Have your employee sign the warning, declaring that they understood and agree with it.Allow the employee the right to dispute the claim as well. Some information may not be correct and they should have the right to question the warning.\n\n",

        "text":" There are strict industry standards for word count in books for children. There are several types of children’s stories, including:Picture books: These books are made for children up to age eight and average 500-1000 words. Picture books contain an image on every page and are published in larger trim sizes, 8.5” x 11”. These books can be written at a higher reading level than the age of the intended audience, as they are often read to a child by an adult.\nEasy reader books: These books are made for children ages five to nine and are usually 50-2500 words. The word count will depend on the publisher and the reading level of the intended reader.\nChapter books: These are short novels for children ages seven to ten and are typically 10,000-12,000 words.\nMiddle grade novels: These books are made for children ages eight to twelve and hover around 20,000-25,000 words.\nYoung adult novels: These books are made for children ages twelve and up and are usually 35,000 to 45,000 words.;\n, Focus on examples of children’s stories that are at the reading level you would like to write for. If you’re interested in creating picture books, head to your local library and go through the picture books section for possible examples and models. Easy reader books and middle grade novels are often written in a series, with multiple titles that revolve around a main character. Some good examples of children’s stories include:\n\n\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are, by Maurice Sendak. This 1963 picture book is one of the most well known and beloved children’s stories.\n\nEloise in Moscow, by Kay Thompson. This easy reader book is the fourth in a series about the adventures of six-year old Eloise.Charlotte’s Web, by E.B. White. A classic chapter book that touches on major themes like grief and the wonders of friendship.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, by Roald Dahl. A classic middle grade novel with a cast of eccentric characters and an engaging plot.The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins. A well known young adult series, comprised of three novels that follow the trials and tribulations of Katniss Everdeen., Choose one to two examples of books that are written in your chosen reading level. As you read through them, ask yourself several questions:\n\n\nDoes the book effectively use its reading level to its advantage? For example, in Where the Wild Things Are, Sendak creates a story that is enjoyable for adults and children to read. This works well as picture books are often read by adults to children. Sendak uses the reading level to appeal to a variety of readers.What genre does the book fall into? The Hunger Games would be considered a dystopian young adult novel, which is part of the science fiction genre. In dystopian novels, the setting is a futuristic universe where an oppressive societal control and the illusion of a perfect society are maintained through totalitarian control.In The Hunger Games, this is the Capitol, led by the oppressive Professor Snow, which is opposed by Katniss.\nIs there a positive message, theme, or moral in the book? In Charlotte's Web, the moral of the book centers on the friendship between the spider, Charlotte and the pig Wilbur. Loyalty is also a big theme of the book, as Charlotte and Fern try to figure out a way to save Wilbur from being slaughtered.How does the writer make the main character interesting and engaging for readers? In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the main character, Charlie Bucket is a sympathetic protagonist. He is unassuming and respectful towards the other characters, lives a poor and undernourished life, and seems deserving of a golden ticket to Mr. Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory.\nIs there an unexpected twist or payoff at the end of the book? In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the unexpected twist at the end of the books occurs when Charlie is the last child standing after a day in Mr. Wonka’s factory. It is then revealed the entire visit has been a test to find Mr. Wonka’s successor as the owner of the factory.How does the writer use word choice and simple language in the book? Compare a picture book, such as Where the Wild Things Are, to a young adult book, such as The Hunger Games. Note how the picture book uses an image on each page, as well as only one or two sentences per a page, to tell a story. A young adult book has no images, and uses long blocks of text, broken up by dialogue, and separated into chapters. As well, a picture book will only use very simple words and terms for a pre-school reading level, while a young adult novel will use marginally complex words and terms for a grade 10-12 reading level.\n\n, There are many types of fiction, from fairytale to fantasy to historical fiction to horror to humor. Some writers begin with a story idea or a character first, rather than a genre. But it can help to pick your genre before outlining your story idea. Popular genres for children’s stories include:Fables, which are stories that have a moral ending. Many fables for children use animals and inanimate objects to portray a theme or moral. For example, The Thomas the Tank Engine book series.\nFolktales, which are stories about commonplace events and characters that seek to explain things in life like nature, or the human condition. There may be make believe elements, like talking animals or natural elements like trees or rivers, as well as supernatural elements. For example, Dragonology: The Complete Book of Dragons.Historical fiction, which are stories that portray a time period or historical event. For example, a young adult novel about the life of Abraham Lincoln called Chasing Lincoln’s Killer.Modern fantasy, which are imaginative tales that require young readers to accept elements and story lines that clearly cannot be true. They require readers to suspend their disbelief and engage with talking animals, elements of science fiction or the supernatural. For example, Charlotte’s Web or Alice in Wonderland.\nDystopian tales, which are a form of science fiction that uses an exaggerated worst-case scenario to critique a current trend, societal norm, or political system. For example, The Hunger Games or The Divergent series.\nRealistic fiction, which are books written around contemporary issues or real-world situations. This genre is similar to historical fiction, but it is based in current events. For example, a young adult novel about terrorism in America or race issues in the deep South.\n\n, Often, the setting of your story will inform the details of your main character and the genre you are writing for. Think about an area you know well, such as your town or city, or a geographical area you would like to learn more about. You will then need to research certain elements of the setting to ensure it seems believable and clear to your reader.If you are writing historical fiction for children set in a certain time period, you will need to do some research about that time period. If you are writing dystopian fiction or a folktale, you can use your imagination to create a unique and slightly futuristic or supernatural setting.\nIn children’s stories, there is no limit to setting. From a spaceship on Mars to a pirate ship in the Caribbean, all these settings can be used for your story.\n\n, Your protagonist, or main character, is going to act as a guide for your reader as they read your story. Your main character should be interesting and endearing enough that your reader cares what happens to her. Main characters in children’s stories are often the same age as the readers, and are typically other kids or animals. Rarely, adults or inanimate objects are also used as main characters in children’s stories.Consider how you can make your main character unique. For example, maybe they have a special ability or power, such as a photographic memory like Encyclopedia Brown of the Encyclopedia Brown chapter book series, or a strong and powerful personality, like Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.\n\n, What is the positive message the story is trying to convey to the reader? This could come down to simple morals, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the power of friendship, doing unto others as you would want for yourself, or doing the right thing means sacrifice and hard work. Many children’s stories use a simple moral to structure the story and place the main character in a situation that causes them to realize the moral or theme.\n\n\nMany main characters use their skill or ability to get out of a potentially bad or tricky situation, such as a dystopian government. You may also use an imaginative setting to show the reader a moral or theme, such as the value of punishment and the value of dreams for the main character, Max, in Where the Wild Things Are., A satisfying ending acts as an unexpected surprise that completes the child’s reading experience. Think of it as the cherry on top of a good story. A twist or payoff should occur at the end of the story and be surprising to the reader.For example, in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Dahl keeps the reader entertained with unique characters, a strange and interesting setting, and situations where characters meet their demise in intriguing ways. By the time the other children have been eliminated through their own greed and gluttony, the reader and Charlie both realize there is only one child left. The payoff then occurs when we find out Mr. Wonka was using the visit to the factory as a test to find his successor and the future owner of the chocolate factory.\n\n, Make those first several sentences count. Begin with action, dialogue, or a description that sets the mood of the story. Start as close as possible to the story’s catalyst, or the aha moment for the main character. This is the moment where your main character’s life shifts from ordinary to extraordinary and the plot of the story takes off.For example, on the first page of the picture book Imogene’s Antlers, the first sentence starts right in conflict: “On Thursday, when Imogene woke up, she found she had grown antlers.”\nImogene’s matter of fact reaction, placed next to the illustrations in the book, create an intriguing image to begin the story.\n\n, Part of creating tension and interest in a story is letting your main character make a mistake or get in trouble. This will allow your character to change or shift by the end of the story and keep your reader engaged.Gauge how much trouble your character should get into based on the age group you are writing for. A four year old boy atoning for not eating his vegetables by being forced by his mother to fight to the death? Probably not an appropriate level of trouble. But a 16 year old girl living in a dystopian future where she is forced to fight to the death for her family? More of an age appropriate level of trouble for your main character.\n\n, When writing for children, one big mistake writers make is allowing adults to come in a solve all the kid’s problems for them. Most child readers want to have a child protagonist who can solve their own issues or use adults only when necessary. Though parents can be involved, they should remain in the background or the peripheral of the main story. Let your main character work out the problem for themselves and don’t rely on authority figures to solve all the issues or provide the answers.\n\n\nHaving strong children characters will be empowering for young readers. It tells children that if the child character could work out a solution to a problem, maybe they can too.\n\n, Descriptions should show how your protagonist operates within the setting or how they feel about the other characters. Try to interpret all the details of a setting or scene through the eyes of your main character.For example, in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the narrative is in the third person, but it stays very close to Charlie’s perspective. The narrative describes Charlie’s walk home past the chocolate factory as “every day, as came near to it, he would lift his small pointed nose high in the air and sniff the wonderful sweet smell of melting chocolate.”This tells the reader about Charlie’s appreciation of the factory, gives some physical description of Charlie, and shows Charlie’s isolation from the factory, as he can only smell the wonderful chocolate rather than eat it himself.\n\n, The dialogue in your story should also match the age and perspective of your main character. If you are writing from the perspective of a seven year old girl, for example, you likely will not be using terms like “utilize” “pontificate” and “summarize”. Instead, you may use basic terms that are easy for a seven year old reader to understand and which seem more likely to come out of a seven year old’s mouth.\n\n\nIn Where The Wild Things Are, Sendak gives the monsters a unique voice, and uses punctuation, such as exclamation marks, to mark their speech. However, the monster still use simple terms that are easy for children and adults to understand. For example, “Let the wild rumpus begin!” and “Oh, please don’t go-we’ll eat you up, we love you so!”\n\n, A few adjectives and adverbs are fine for children’s books written for a higher age level, from chapter books to young adult. But avoid packing your sentences with modifiers, as strong verbs can often work better than lots of adjectives and adverbs. In children’s stories, especially chapter books and young adult books, writers often use strong verbs to convey physical and emotional qualities of the characters or of a setting or scene.For example, in a passage from The Hunger Games, Collins uses strong verbs to convey a sense of action and tension.“A boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the ground.”\nUsing verbs like “reaches” “grapple” “stagger” “slips” creates a strong image in the reader’s mind, without confusing them or jolting them out of the story. However, notice that Collins does not use any adverbs, but still creates strong sentences. She appeals to the reading level, without sacrificing any tension in the story.\n\n, Remember that most children’s stories, particularly picture books and easy reader books, are illustrated. Keep the visuals of the book in mind as you create the story. In many picture books, the illustrations must be just as effective as the words on the page and their should be a strong connection between the images and text.For example, Where the Wild Things Are is known as much for the text and the story as it is for the illustrations, which bring the monsters of Max’s imagination to life for the reader.\n\n",

        "text":"A persona (plural personae or personas) is a strategic mask of identity in public, the public image of one's personality, the social role that one adopts, or simply a fictional character. It is also considered \"an intermediary between the individual and the institution.\"\n\nPersona studies is an academic field developed by communication and media scholars. The term “persona” has been discussed by sociologists Robert Park and Erving Goffman in the 1950s. It is a tool to become persons by constructing the conception of our role and connecting the inner conception to the outer world as individuals. Yet, the terminology of identity and personae has been applied loosely and both imply the impressions of self and social performances in their works.\n\nThe word derives from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The usage of the word dates back to the beginnings of Latin civilization. The Latin word derived from the Etruscan word \",\" with the same meaning, and that from the Greek  (). It is the etymology of the word \"person,\" or \"parson\" in French. Latin etymologists explained that persona comes from \"per\/sonare\" as \"the mask through which (per) resounds the voice (of the actor).\"\n\nIts meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a \"character\" of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role and that legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance.\n\nIn psychology\n\nAccording to Carl Jung and the Jungian psychology, the persona is also the mask or appearance one presents to the world. It may appear in dreams under various guises. People may choose to wear a social mask or use a persona to make themselves appear more socially desirable. This is used to impress potential partners or to make new friends. People can have multiple personas that they use in various situations; this can include work, being with friends, at home, etc. Depending on the individual's circumstance, a persona which they consider stronger within their specific social situation can be created because they put a higher emphasis on social interactions. Jung warned about using personas too much, fearing that one might lose their own individuality to their persona. A study has shown that this can be true to an extent; when taking a private self-rating test, there is a high correlation between how a person rates themselves and how they present themselves in public. It is difficult to tell if people are accurately filling out the test or answering what they find desirable.\n\nIn a study written by Danielle Jackson, she argues that a person's persona can range in healthiness. The more healthy a persona is, the more socially acceptable and consistent that person remains. However, once a person starts to believe they are their persona, it can have adverse effects on their personality. James Hillman believed that once a person loses their identity to a persona, they become an archetypal figure. By losing their \"ego\", their persona becomes their personality in an archetypal form. However, when this occurs, the person becomes unstable and they are unable to act outside their formed persona.\n\nIn literature\n\nIn literature, the term generally refers to a character established by an author, one in whose voice all or part of a narrative takes place. Poets such as Robert Browning, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot are strongly associated with such narrative voices, as is the writer Luigi Pirandello. These writers understood the term slightly differently and derived its use and meaning from different traditions. Examples of Eliot's personae were \"Prufrock\" and Sweeney. Pound developed such characters as Cino, Bertran de Born, Propertius, and Mauberley in response to figures in Browning’s dramatic monologues. Whereas Eliot used \"masks\" to distance himself from aspects of modern life which he found degrading and repulsive, Pound's personae were often poets and could be considered in good part alter egos. For Pound, the personae were a way of working through a specific poetic problem. In this sense, the persona is a transparent mask, wearing the traits of two poets and responding to two situations, old and new, which are similar and overlapping.\n\nIn literary analysis, any narrative voice that speaks in the first person and appears to define a particular character is often referred to as a persona. It is contrasted with a third-person narrative voice, generally taken to be more objective and impersonal. There are borderline cases, such as the “we” that occurs late in Edwin Arlington Robinson's poem and functions something like a chorus in a Greek tragedy, but in general any identifiable narrator whose point of view or manner of speaking clearly distinguishes them from the author is considered a literary persona.\n\nIn fan fiction and in online stories, the personas may especially reflect the authors' self-insertion.\n\nMusical Persona\n\nThe Concept of Musical Persona \nThe concept of persona in music was introduced by Edward T. Cone in his The Composer's Voice (1974), that dealt with the relation between the lyrical self of a song's lyrics and its composer. Performance studies scholar Philip Auslander includes further contextual frames, in which musical persona is the primary product of musical performances apart from the original text. Auslander argues that music is a primary social frame as a \"principle of organization which govern events.\" In addition, he categorizes three types of personae transformation: lateral moves within the same frame at a given moment; movements from one frame to another; and within a single frame that changes over time and hypothesizes that personae transformation could only happen when the genre framing changes. As a strategic formation of public identity in communities, musical personae describe how music moves through cultures. Persona maintains stability of performance with the expectation from the audience matching in musical presentation.\n\nThe concept of persona can also be used to refer to an instrumentalist, like a pianist and their playing style, although the term is more commonly used to refer to the voice and performance nuances of a vocalist in a studio album or in a live concert. In online spaces where personae are more visible, musical personae can be created through the flexible and fluid virtual bodies of avatars.\n\nUsually, the performers assume a role that matches the music they sing on stage, though they may also be composers. Many performers make use of a persona. Some artists create various characters, especially if their career is long and they go through many changes over time. For example, David Bowie initially adopted a role as alien messenger Ziggy Stardust, and later as The Thin White Duke. More than just artistic pseudonyms, the personae are independent characters used in the artist's shows and albums (in this example, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars and Station to Station). However, in music, a persona does not always mean a change. Some authors have noted that Bob Dylan's charisma is due largely to his almost stereotyped image, always with a harmonica, guitar, and with his distinctive hair, nasal voice, and clothing. The persona also serves to claim a right or to draw attention to a certain subject. That is the case of Marilyn Manson and his interest in death and morbidity, and Madonna and her interest in sexuality.\n\nExamples\n\nAmerican Artists \n\n Beyoncé: the persona of Beyoncé, \"Sasha Fierce\", appears on the album I Am... Sasha Fierce. According to Beyoncé, Sasha is her wilder side, emerging during high octane stage performances and serving as a sort of scapegoat for \"unladylike\" behavior.\n Lady Gaga: Jo Calderone, the persona of Gaga, performed at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Jo represents a drag male persona, and is often used in the performance of her song, \"You and I\".\n Nicki Minaj: she employs multiple personae, ranging from what she calls the Harajuku Barbie persona to Roman Zolanski, a Polish homosexual. The personae were heavily used in her sophomore album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded.\n\nBritish Artists \n\n Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones: he takes the guise of Satan in the song \"Sympathy for the Devil\" or of a housewife in \"Slave\"\n Spice Girls: each member of girl group adopted personas based on nicknames given to them by the British press. According to Music Week, these personas (\"Ginger\", \"Posh\", \"Baby\", \"Sporty\" and \"Scary\") played a key role in the group's international marketability. Spice Girl Melanie C later said the personas were \"like a protection mechanism because it was like putting on this armour of being this, this character, rather than it actually being you.\"\n the Beatles: they presents a group persona of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, including the character Billy Shears \"played by\" drummer Ringo Starr.\n\nIn marketing and user experience design\n\nPersonas are used in marketing and advertising by creating a marketing persona that represents a group or segment of customers so that the company can focus its efforts. For example, online advertising agencies can monitor pictures, browsing history and the ads people surfing the internet generally select or choose to click, and based on that data they tailor their merchandise to a targeted audience or better describe a customer segments using a data driven approach.\n\nPersonas are also used in user experience design, known as user personas. Alan Cooper introduced personas in his book, The Inmates Are Running the Asylum (1998). Cooper play-acted fictitious characters in order to help solve design questions. These personas need to be based on user research and can also be described in narrative form. Creating personas has become synonymous with creating a document, known as persona profile, instead of an \"activity of empathetic role-play\".\n\nSee also\nAlter ego\nAvatar\nCharacter mask\nCostume\nDissociative identity disorder\nDoppelgänger\nFursona, a term for a furry's persona\nStage name\nSailor Saturn \nPseudonym\nNom de plume\nRebirth\/Reincarnation\n\nCitations\n\nLiterary criticism\nLiterary theory",

        "text":" You can select from a variety of materials that can work as a rope. You can get an actual rope from your local hardware store, or you can use ropes made of leather, PVC, or elastic.\n\n\nDifferent fabrics of rope will have an effect on the speed, durability and versatility of your rope.For example, leather ropes are great for speed, but can feel like a whip when it hits your skin, so it's not a great choice for children.;\n, Measure the length from the top of your chest to your feet. Multiply it times two. The total number will give you a good length to cut your rope.\n\n\nIf you are not making the jump rope for yourself you will need to get those measurements from the person you are making the jump rope for.\nIf you can't get a measurement, you can just go with a 7-foot rope for most children. For people between 5'2\"-5'6\" you can use an 8-foot rope. From 5'6\"-6'2\" you can use a 9-foot rope. And for people taller than 6'3\" go with a 10-foot rope.You can always adjust the knots to shorten the rope later on, so it's best to have a little extra length to begin with.\nYou will want to use a much longer rope if you plan to do double dutch jumping. A rope of 12 feet will be sufficient for one jumper, and add 2-4 feet for each additional jumper., Handles will have a big impact on how your jump rope performs. You can purchase some handles at a sporting goods store, or make some yourself using items around your home.\n\n\nTo make some handles at home you can cut two pieces of 1\/2-inch PVC pipe in equal lengths of 4-8 inches depending on your preference. Drill a hole in two 1\/2 inch PVC end caps that is wide enough for your rope.\nYou could also cut a wooden dowel into similar lengths. Drill a hole that is wide enough for your rope through the center of the dowel.If you are making a jump rope for children, you will want the handle to be small and light enough for a child to hold easily.\nIf you are making a jump rope as a piece of exercise equipment, you will get more benefit by using handles that have some more weight. This will challenge your arm muscles more when you exercise.\n\n, Jump rope beads serve several different purposes. They make the jump rope more visible, which is desirable for performances and safer for children. The beads also make a louder sound when they hit the ground, which helps some jump ropers to keep a good rhythm. Beads can also add a little weight to a rope which can alter the feel and performance. They also help to protect the rope.\n\n, You can paint the handles your favorite color. Adding some tassels to the ends of the handles can make the jump rope even more exciting for kids. You can even find beads with letters to personalize the rope.\n\n, If you are using beads, you will need to slide the rope through them first, then secure the ends with the handles.\n\n\nTry alternating colors. Select two different colors of beads. Slide on a bead of one color, then the other color. Repeat until the rope is full.\n\n, Take one of the rope and feed it through one handle. Then take the opposite end of the rope and feed it through the other end of the rope. Be sure the handle ends face opposite directions at each end of the rope.\n\n, How you secure the rope will vary depending on your rope and handle choice. Some cord ropes will come with a cap that tightens or crimps around the cord to hold it to the handle.For most cloth and elastic materials you can simply tie a knot at each end of the rope so that the ends will not slip through the handles.\n\n\nTo tie the rope hold it in front of you several inches from the end of the rope. With your other hand make a loop on one side of the rope, bringing the end behind the bulk of the rope. Make another loop on the other side of the rope, bringing the end across in front of the rope. Then pull the end through the top loop and tighten. This knot will stay secured until you untie it., The fabric will harden and seal the tips to prevent them from fraying. You can also dip them in glue to help seal the ends of the ropes.\n\n, If the rope seems too long then you can adjust the jump rope as needed.\n\n\nHaving a longer rope than necessary will mean the rope will take longer to rotate. This can be beneficial for new jumpers or children. Conversely, if you are an experienced jumper and looking to increase your speed, you will want the rope to have as little excess rope as possible.\n\n, Pull the unwanted length of rope through the handle. Try using the rope again. When it seems like a good length, tie a knot at one end of the rope again and cut off the excess with a pair of scissors. If you have clips for your handles you can simply adjust them and trim away the excess.\n\n\nSome handles have extra room so you can make a loop in the rope to adjust the size and fit the loop within the body of the handle. If your handles have the space, you might want to consider using this method to resize your rope. It is quicker and will give you the ability to add some length back to the rope later on if you want.\n\n",

Ignoring the bases out of the batter's control makes this a more accurate measure of offensive power.;\n, Most player stats don't include singles, but it's easy to figure out from other stats.

She was later transferred to Puget Sound and became one of the better known steamboats operating there.\n\nConstruction and Early Operations\nShe was built for the run from Portland to Oregon City and was considered one of the top boats on the Willamette River at the time.  One of her early captains was James D. Miller (1830–1914).\n\nTransfer to Puget Sound\n\nIn 1889, Multnomah was transferred to Puget Sound, where under the ownership of the S. Willey Navigation Company she made regular runs from Olympia to points on Puget Sound.  In 1900, Captain H.H. McDonald (1857–1924), who had already been operating the sternwheelers Elwood and Skagit Queen on the lower Sound, bought Multnomah and Capital City (ex-Dalton) from S. Willey Navigation, and put them in competition with the Greyhound, which had been taken off the Seattle-Tacoma run.  There was a rate war between the two concerns, and eventually Greyhound’s owners, acting as the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company, bought Multnomah and Capital City from Captain McDonald.  Captain George W. Barlow, a son of an Oregon pioneer family, commanded all three vessels at various times; he retired in 1910.\n\nIn 1900, Multnomah and City of Aberdeen hauled beer from the Olympia Brewery to various points on Puget Sound.  Once acquired by the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company, Greyhound ran with Multnomah on the Seattle-Tacoma-Olympia route, making at various smaller landings in the South Sound, including Three Tree Point and Johnson’s Landing on Anderson Island.\n\nOther captains for the Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company included George L. Hill, who was in command on  November 10, 1904 when Multnomah collided with the French full-rigged ship Amiral Cecile in Commencement Bay.  In foggy conditions, the steamboat passed under the bowsprit of the ship, and the ship’s anchor flukes caught in the steamer’s upper works, tearing them up.  Litigation went on for eight years over this, amid apparently credible charges that witnesses had been paid off.\n\nIn 1907, Multnomah was converted from wood to oil-fired boilers.  Almost all the boats built after 1905 were oil-fired, and they had improved locomotive-style boilers which lessened the chances of explosion.  The Olympia-Tacoma Navigation Company kept both Multnomah and Greyhound on the Tacoma-Olympia run until 1911, when they were replaced with the new express propeller steamer Nisqually.  Even then, bus lines (called then the “auto stage”) were starting to compete with the steamboats.  At some point she was assigned work as a towboat.\n\nCollision and sinking\n\nMultnomah met her end on October 28, 1911, when in a dense fog in Elliott Bay, she was rammed by the steamer Iroquois, sinking in 240 feet of water.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\nHistoric photographs from on-line collections of University of Washington\nMultnomah at Chautauqua Dock, Vashon Island\nMultnomah, apparently on Puget Sound\n\nWebsite\nhistory of sternwheeler Multnomah, with photos and reports of early dives to her wreck\n\nHistory of Washington (state)\nPaddle steamers of Oregon\nSteamboats of the Columbia River\nMaritime incidents in 1911\nSteamboats of Washington (state)\nShips built in Portland, Oregon\n1885 ships",

The teenagers at your school will be more than happy if you do allow these phones.  Cell phones should be accepted into your school during free times because no issues should occur, teens will like school more   in case of emergency.\n Offering the young educators their cell phones in school should not be an issue. As long as the kids in the school do not use the phones in class there will be no harm done. If a young adult does exercise their phone during a class hour then the phone should be taken away for a week. this will cause kids to not want to use their phones in class. One of my friends has used their cell phones in class before. He was caught and was told not to use it again. After this he never applied his phone again. Kids should be allowed to have their cell phones in school.  Another reason to allow cell phones is teens would like your school and you as a principle. I have always wanted to go to a school where you had the decision to interact with your phone during pass times or during lunch periods. Many kids would want to go to this middle school. These cell phones should be allowed in school.  One last reason to allow phones is in case of an emergency. If someone is hurt but is alone in a class they should be allowed to call for help. 911 is an important number to dial in the case of any type of emergency. Schools will need to allow phones for many reasons one of them is to avoid harm.  Your school should allow cell phones because of no issues, kid will like your school and in case of an emergency.",

        "text":"UPDATE:  I have read the authors' responses.  I did not read the social media comments about this paper prior to reviewing it.  \n\nI appreciate the authors' updates in response to the reviewer comments.  Overall, however, my review stands.  The authors have taken a task that had not yet been addressed with a straightforward modern deep learning approach, and addressed it with such an approach.  I assume that if we pick up any task that hasn't been worked on for a while, and give it a solid deep learning treatment, we will do well.  I do not see such papers as a contribution to ICLR, unless they also provide new insights, analysis, or surprising results (which, to my mind, this paper does not).  This is a general point and the program chairs may disagree with it, of course.\n\nI have removed my recommendation that this be accepted as a workshop paper, as I have since noticed that the workshop track this year has a different focus.  \n\n************************\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThe authors show that an appropriately engineered LSTM+CNN+CTC network does an excellent job of lipreading on the GRID corpus.  This is a nice result to know about--yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task--and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).  However, this in itself is not sufficiently novel for publication at ICLR.  The paper also needs to be revised to better represent prior work, and ideally remove some of the vague motivational language.  Some specifics on what I think needs to be revised:\n\n- First, the claim of being the first to do sentence-level lipreading.  As mentioned in a pre-review comment, this is not true.  The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).  Ideally the title should also be changed in light of this.\n\n- The comparison with human lipreaders needs to be qualified a bit.  This task is presumably very unnatural for humans because of the unusual grammar, so perhaps what you are showing is that a machine can better take into account the strong contraints.  This is great, but not a general statement about LipNet vs. humans.\n\n- The paper contains some unnecessary motivational platitudes.  We do not need to invoke Easton and Basala 1982 to motivate modeling context in a linguistic sequence prediction task, and prior work using older sequence models (e.g. HMMs) for lipreading has modeled context as well.  The McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication.\n\n- It is worth noting that even without the spatial convolution, your Baseline-2D already does extremely well.  So I am not sure about the \"importance of spatiotemporal feature extraction\" as stated in the conclusion.\n\nSome more minor comments, typos, etc.:\n\n- citations for LSTMs, CTC, etc. should be provided the first time they are mentioned.\n- I did not quite follow the justification for upsampling.\n- what is meant by \"lip-rounding vowels\"?  They seem to include almost all English vowels.\n- Did you consider keeping the vowel visemes V1-V4 separate rather than collapsing them into one?  Since you list Neti et al.'s full viseme set, it is worth mentioning why you modified it.\n- \"Given that the speakers are British, the confusion between \/aa\/ and \/ay\/...\" -- I am not sure what this has to do with British speakers, as the relationship between these vowels exists in other English dialects as well (e.g. American).\n- The discussion about confusions within bilabial stops and within alveolar stops is a bit mismatched with the actual confusion data in Fig. 3(b,c).  For example, there does not seem to be any confusion between \/m\/ and \/b\/ or between \/m\/ and \/p\/.\n- \"lipreading actuations\":  I am not sure what \"actuations\" means in this context\n- \"palato-alvealoar\" --> \"palato-alveolar\"\n- \"Articulatorily alveolar\" --> \"Alveolar\"?",

He reprised his role in Tiffany's Attic in Kansas City, MO in 1985 where he co-starred with Leslie Jordan. \n\nHis second play Daddy's Dyin': Who's Got the Will? saw a 1987 debut in Los Angeles at Theatre\/Theater, running two years to critical acclaim. A movie version by the same name was released in 1990 by MGM starring Beau Bridges, Tess Harper, Judge Reinhold, Keith Carradine, Patrika Darbo, and Beverly D'Angelo. Shores wrote the screenplay and executive produced the feature.\n\nPerhaps Shores' best known play is his fourth, Sordid Lives, which debuted in 1996 in Los Angeles. The comedy centered on the Texan Ingram family and touched on LGBT themes. In 1999 Shores wrote and directed the screen version of Sordid Lives. Eight years later Shores produced 12 prequel episodes of Sordid Lives: The Series which aired on American LGBT-interest cable channel Logo with a much-anticipated sequel, A Very Sordid Wedding, premiering in 2016 with a mixture of the film and series cast, with Levi Kreis, Emerson Collins, Katherine Bailess, T. Ashanti Mozelle, Dale Dickey, Whoopi Goldberg, Alec Mapa, and Carole Cook joining the cast.\n\nIn 2010, Shores debuted his play Yellow at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood.

        "text":"The Alliance Party, was the ruling political party in Fiji from 1966 to 1987.  Founded in the early 1960s, its leader was Kamisese Mara, the founding father of the modern Fijian nation.  Widely seen as the political vehicle of the traditional Fijian chiefs, the Alliance Party also commanded considerable support among the Europeans and other ethnic minorities, who, although comprising only 3–4% of Fiji's population, were over represented in the parliament (with a third of the seats before 1973, and a sixth thereafter, allocated to them).  Indo-Fijians were less supportive, but the Fijian-European block vote kept the Alliance Party in power for more than twenty years.\n\nFormation of the Alliance Party\nThe formation of the Alliance Party was the direct result of the call, in November 1965, by the Governor, Sir Derek Jakeway, \"for leaders of imagination, who have the interests of all the people of Fiji truly at heart, to build political alliances with the object of contesting elections on a common racial platform and then, if they win a majority of seats, forming a broad based administration which will be effectively self-governing\". In 1965, there already existed in Fiji political organisations which represented various interest groups (but no other political party like the Federation Party). These were the Fijian Association, which was formed in 1956 to \"counter the Indian demand for political reform\", the National Congress of Fiji formed by Indians opposed to the Federation Party, the General Electors Association representing the Europeans and Part-Europeans, the Suva Rotuman Association, the Rotuman Convention, the Chinese Association, the All-Fiji Muslim Political Front, the Fiji Minority Party and the Tongan Organization. On 12 March 1966, all these organisations came together under the leadership of Kamisese Mara to form the Alliance Party.\n\n1966 general election\nWhen the 1966 general election was held, the Alliance Party had been in existence for only six months, consequently there was little co-ordination of activities between its affiliated organisations. Candidate selection was not streamlined and in four Fijian communal constituencies, the Fijian Association allowed its own members to stand against the Alliance endorsed candidates. Some candidates for the Indian communal constituencies stood in the election under the National Congress of Fiji banner. Sometimes individual ambition superseded party loyalty as seen by the case where a European member, on failing to obtain Alliance endorsement, resigned, stood as an independent, won the election, re-joined the Alliance and was made a Minister. In the end, the Alliance, won a landslide victory, taking 22 of the 34 directly elected seats. Its greatest achievement was winning the three cross-voting seats in the western division, where the large Indian majority was expected to elect Federation Party candidates. After the election the three independents and two nominees of the Great Council of Chiefs, also joined the Alliance to give it a total of 27 seats.  The remaining 9 seats were won by the NFP, led by A. D. Patel.  Owing to the victory of the Alliance, Ratu Mara was appointed Chief Minister when responsible government was introduced in September 1967.\n\n1977 to 1987\nThe rule of the Alliance Party was briefly challenged in the election of March 1977, when a split in the ethnic Fijian vote resulted in the loss of nine seats.  The Alliance ended up with 24 seats in the 52-seat parliament, two less than the Indo-Fijian-dominated National Federation Party (NFP).  A constitutional crisis developed when, three days after the election, the NFP splintered in a leadership brawl, and the Governor General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau, asked the Mara government to remain in power in a caretaker capacity.  A second election was held in September that year to resolve the impasse; the Alliance was returned with an unprecedented 36 seats out of 52.\n\nThe majority of the Alliance Party was reduced in the 1982 election, but with 28 seats out of 52, it retained office.  In April 1987, the party was finally beaten by a multi-racial coalition led by Timoci Bavadra, an ethnic Fijian who nevertheless drew most of his support from the Indo-Fijian population.\n\nAfter less than a month in office, the new government was deposed in a military coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka.  After several months of turmoil, the former Prime Minister Ratu Mara, the Alliance Party leader, was called back to head a transitional government.  As part of a major realignment of Fijian politics, however, the Alliance Party was dissolved.\n\nAttempts to revive the Alliance\nMore than fifteen years after the disbanding of the Fijian Alliance, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs from 2001 to 2004, and a son-in-law of the late Ratu Mara, formally registered the National Alliance Party of Fiji on 18 January 2005 as a claimed successor to the defunct party.  Ganilau launched the new party at a mass rally in Suva on 8 April 2005.\n\nThe Fijian Alliance was considered to be a centre-right party, and was a member of the International Democrat Union, an umbrella-organization of moderate right-wing parties from many countries, including the Republican Party of the United States, the British Conservative Party, and the Australian Liberal Party.\n\nReferences\n\nDefunct political parties in Fiji\nConservative parties in Fiji\nDefunct conservative parties\nPolitical parties established in 1966\n1966 establishments in Fiji\nPolitical parties disestablished in 1987",

        "text":"E-ZPass Minnesota, formerly MnPass (Pronounced \"Minn pass\") is the brand name associated with a series of high occupancy toll lanes (HO\/T lanes) in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area of Minnesota and is also associated with the electronic toll collection (ETC) system used for those HO\/T lanes. The lanes and the ETC system are owned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) and fully compatible with the multi-state E-ZPass network.\n\nSolo drivers who are registered under the E-ZPass program and have a toll transponder are allowed to pay a toll to use the lanes during operating hours. Vehicles with two or more occupants, buses, and motorcycles may use the lanes for free without requiring a toll transponder.\n\nTransponders\n\nThe primary device is a switchable tag. The switchable tag allows users to switch between HOV mode (where using the lanes is free) and solo mode (where users must pay the toll to use the lanes). The current transponder is a rebranded E-ZPass Flex tag which is also used in other states.\n\nThe license plate tag is used for vehicles that have a metallic tint on their windshield that would prevent the E-ZPass equipment from reading the tag. There is a $15 one-time fee for the license plate tag, which otherwise functions the same as the sticker tag.\n\nThe initial minimum prepaid amount for a E-ZPass Minnesota account is $25, plus the cost of an transponder type if applicable.\n\nSmall commercial vehicles that are no more than two axles and weigh less than  are eligible to register for a E-ZPass account and transponder. Commercial vehicles with more than two axles or weigh more than  are prohibited from having a transponder, but may still use the E-ZPass lanes when the lanes are free and open to all traffic.\n\nUntil August 2, 2021, the MnPASS system was not interoperable with other transponder-based toll systems, such as E-ZPass, I-Pass, or FasTrak. E-ZPass became interoperable with the MnPASS system starting on August 2, 2021, and MnPass was rebranded as E-ZPass Minnesota. Existing MnPASS holders are allowed to keep their tags or trade them for E-ZPass tags, and existing MnPASS transponders continue to function on Minnesota toll roads (but not on other states' toll roads).\n\nBefore joining the E-ZPass system in 2021, a sticker tag was the default tag, and was provided for free. Existing sticker tag transponders are still valid in Minnesota but cannot be used outside of the state. Applied to the inside of the windshield it is not transferable and is always active.\n\nToll rates\n\nDuring E-ZPass Minnesota operating hours, tolls for the E-ZPass lanes range from $0.25 to $8. The actual toll level depends on the volume of traffic.  Higher volumes of traffic usually result in higher toll levels. Electronic sensors monitor the traffic density and tolls are changed every three minutes. The variable tolls are intended to keep traffic in the E-ZPass lanes moving between . Outside of operating hours, there is no toll and the lanes are free (signed simply as \"OPEN\") and open to all traffic (regardless of whether they have a transponder or not) with one exception: the reversible E-ZPass lanes on Interstate 394 (I-394) between Minnesota State Highway 100 (MN 100) and I-94 always has a minimum $0.25 toll and thus are not open to solo drivers without a E-ZPass transponder.\n\nI-394\/U.S. Highway 12\n \nThe I-394 MnPASS lanes opened in May 2005 and were the first such lanes in Minnesota. The lanes were converted from the previous high-occupancy vehicle lanes that were constructed with I-394 in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nWest of the Xenia\/Park Place interchange (just west of MN 100, the E-ZPass lanes function as concurrent flow lanes, utilizing the inside\/left lane in each direction. These lanes are separated from the general purpose lanes only by lane striping, as are the I-35W and I-35E E-ZPass lanes. The lane striping ranges from a single dashed white line where lane changes (and E-ZPass lane access) is allowed to double solid white lines where lane changing is prohibited. The westbound E-ZPass lane ends at the I-494 overpass (continuing west of I-494 as a general purpose lane), while the eastbound E-ZPass lane begins at the County Road 15 (CR 15) interchange on U.S. Highway 12 (US 12) in Wayzata. These concurrent flow E-ZPass lanes are tolled eastbound between 6 and 10 am weekdays and westbound between 3 and 7 pm weekdays. They are open to all traffic at all other times.\n\nEast of the Xenia\/Park Place interchange, the E-ZPass lanes transition to a pair of median-running reversible lanes that are physically separated from the general purpose lanes by a concrete barrier. These lanes extend to the edge of downtown Minneapolis before ending and merging into the I-394 mainline at I-94. Intermediate access to these reversible E-ZPass lane is limited to MN 100, the south frontage road at MN 100, Dunwoody Boulevard\/Van White Boulevard, and I-94 in the direction of the Lowry Hill Tunnel. The lanes are open eastbound (towards downtown) from 6am to 1pm daily, and westbound (away from downtown) daily from 2pm to 5am the following morning. Hours may vary due to special events or maintenance activities.\n\nThere were a total of over 1.3 million tolled trips taken in the I-394 MnPASS lanes in 2017.\n\nI-35W\nThe E-ZPass lanes along I-35W south of downtown Minneapolis were opened in stages between 2009 and 2011 and are a combination of new construction (south of Burnsville Parkway), conversion of the previously existing high-occupancy vehicle lanes (between Burnsville Parkway and 66th Street), construction related to the Crosstown Commons project, and conversion of a median shoulder into a priced dynamic shoulder lane. The lanes are concurrent-flow lanes using the inside\/left lane in each direction. The northbound E-ZPass lane begins at CR 42 and extends continuously to 26th Street. The southbound E-ZPass Lane begins just south of 42nd Street and extends to Cliff Road.\n\nThe northbound E-ZPass lane is tolled weekdays between 6 and 10 am and the segment north of MN 62 is also tolled between 3 and 7 pm. The southbound E-ZPass lane is tolled weekdays between 3 and 7 pm with the segment between 42nd Street and I-494 also tolled between 6 and 10 am. The lanes are open to all traffic at all other times.\n\nAlmost 950,000 tolled trips were taken in the I-35W MnPASS lanes in 2017.\n\nThe future Orange Line bus rapid transitway is expected to heavily utilize the I-35W MnPASS lanes.\n\nI-35E\nThe I-35E E-ZPass lanes are the first such lanes in the eastern half of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area. These are concurrent-flow lanes, using the inside\/left lane in each direction. The lanes were opened from Cayuga Street (north edge of downtown St. Paul) to Little Canada Road in December 2015 and were added as part of a full reconstruction project. In December 2016, the southbound E-ZPass lane was extended to begin at CR 96, while a separate northbound E-ZPass Lane was added between CR E (north of I-694) and CR J (at the Ramsey–Anoka county line. The two northbound E-ZPass lanes are tolled weekdays between 3 and 7 pm, while the southbound E-ZPass lane is tolled weekdays between 6 and 10 am.

Tentative completion is 2021.\n\nE-ZPass lanes will be added to I-35W between CR C in Roseville and Lexington Avenue\/CR 17 in Blaine in an upcoming project beginning in 2019 with completion expected in 2022.\n\nMnDOT is currently studying the I-94 corridor between downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul. No recommendations have come out of this study yet as of April 2018. However, the corridor is listed as a Tier 1 Corridor for E-ZPass implementation by the Metropolitan Council, the region's metropolitan planning organization.\n\nMnDOT is currently studying the US 169 corridor between MN 41 near Shakopee and MN 55 in Plymouth.

Reversing this dynamic defines a generative model.\nWhen the forward noising process is given by a Stochastic Differential Equation\n(SDE), Song et al.

A limitation\nof this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently\nlong time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian. In contrast,\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized\noptimal transport problem on path spaces, yields diffusions which generate\nsamples from the data distribution in finite time. We present Diffusion SB\n(DSB), an original approximation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF)\nprocedure to solve the SB problem, and provide theoretical analysis along with\ngenerative modeling experiments. The first DSB iteration recovers the\nmethodology proposed by Song et al.

Leading to and unnecessary crash.\n Nearly over 300 hundred k people are injured. From accidents caused by texting while driving.  In the United States approximately 9 people are killed and over a thousand were injured in crashes because they were distracted. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Teens have been the largest age group reported driving distracted. It has been reported to be over 50% of teens crashes. People should stop driving with cell phones because it end other people's lives. Even a two minute drive going to the store of you picking up your phone can cause a crash. Might not be a major crash but it could ´ve been avoided. Should only be on your phone if you're parked.  People should have an hands-free set in the car it's safe because they can drive using two hands. Like in the state of Georgia it's illegal to hold your phone while driving even at a red light. The driver can't have the phone touching them while on the phone. It must be on a hands free setup. Hand free stands are helpful. Plus you don't have to worry about getting pulled over. And it somewhat helps the diver from getting distracted All states should consider making it illegal to hold phones while driving. Therefore the average car wreck will go down. These wrecks cause innocent lives leaving loved ones without their family member.    ",

Having a better understanding of the material will help them do well on the tests\/exams.  Teachers can give students \"hands on\" help in the classroom or before\/after school hours. Students need the help that they can get to understand what they are learning. For example, students who are struggling and can't understand the material through the notes or they need extra help, they can get help from their teacher one on one and show the student(s) how to do it. Having this advantage will give students a better opportunity to be sucessful in the classroom.  Students will improve their stamina in the classroom and throughout the day. Students having an overall strong mental stamina will help their confidence and build their knowledge. For example, taking notes, doing time consuming assignments, or in class projects in all a short period of time, will improve students stamina. Having mental stamina will help them do well on tests, SAT's, etc..  School can help students achieve a greter goal in life and their understanding of the education and cirriculum is vital. It is an opportunity to get an occupation that they dream and strive to have. Students may think that they will benefit attending classes from home.

The original Nazis took that phrase because, at the time, it was (wrongly) believed that most of the languages in Europe came from a region of Persia that was home to the actual Aryans. The Nazis then simply claimed there was an \"Aryan race\", and that it was the \"original\" European race and therefore the \"master race\", and that the pure \"Aryans\" were the Germans and Nordic peoples.\n\nThe point is that there is no such thing as an \"Aryan race\", but for many people it simply meant either \"German\" or \"north European\" or \"white\". (Incidentally, if you use \"Caucasian\" to mean \"white\", that's wrong also, for very much the same reason: real Caucasians are very much darker than the average European.) Because the concept was a pure invention, it could mean whatever you wanted it to mean.\n\nAnother point is that not all people we call \"Nazis\" are the same. These days we think of \"Nazi\" as being a general term to describe a particularly nasty sort of racist, but technically speaking a Nazi is a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (which no longer exists). Not all neo-Nazis agree with absolutely everything the Nazi Party believed in.\n\nFor example, the original Nazis were \"völkisch\", meaning they were particularly fascinated by Germanic folklore -- this is why Wagner was such a favourite of Hitler's, as he wrote entire operas based on pre-Christian German sagas -- and wove that into their ideology.\n\nMovements like the \"Alt-right\" movement are technically not actually Nazi, but we use \"neo-Nazi\" to mean \"modern movement that looks horribly like Nazism\". They don't have to sign up to everything the Nazis believed, they just have to have an ideology based heavily on white nationalism or white supremecy. For American white nationalists, this means broadening the concept of the \"master race\" to all whites, or at least all people of European descent.",

It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different  The fact that we have to vote electors for those electors to choose our president, it seems unfair.  Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. To continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president?  As stated in source 2 \"The Indefinsible Electoral College\",\"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state,candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\"states.\" In addition, it states in source 3 \"In defense of the Electoral College\",\" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.  Furthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens  The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, \"Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...\" There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.  On the other hand, Electoral College could have benifits  In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.  In conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used. It could change society and it will allow us to have a better living. This could give us a chance to vote and feel part of the election.",

        "text":" Watch video or have a coach demonstrate spiking a volleyball using topspin. The more you see a spiker create topspin, the more you'll understand what it means exactly to spike with topspin.;\n, We want to learn to spike with topspin a quickly as possible. The quickest and most efficient method to learning how to create topspin is by first practicing the spike in slow motion. The key to creating topspin is contacting the ball in a claw-like hand position. This hand position is also called the cobra. Practice the volleyball spike arm swing in slow motion while keeping the hand in a claw-like position during the entire movement. This trains the spiker to be in the claw-like position at pre-contact. Do this in slow motion for 5 to 10 minutes. For faster results, use a camcorder to record the spiker and immediately watch the video. Training in slow motion isn't easy, but is the fastest way to learn the technique for creating topspin.\n\n, Don't make the mistake of trying to do the full volleyball approach and create topspin. The best way to learn topspin is to chunk down the volleyball approach. Therefore, the next step is to just focus on contacting the ball. Get a partner and practice the arm swing spiking motion, spiking the ball to one another. Focus just as before on keeping the hand in a claw-like position during the entire movement. Watch the the rotation of the ball as it travels in the air. If the ball isn't spinning, then the contact was poor. Typically, the better the contact, the more the ball will stick to the hand. The entire hand should be contacting the ball, not just the palm. The entire hand should be wrapped around the ball.\n\n, The easiest way to serve topspin is by contacting the ball more back behind your head. The idea is to reach back further than you normally would while keeping the hand in the cobra position as you swing through the ball. The big difference between serving floaters and serving topspin is how energy is sent through the ball. With float serves, energy is sent through the center of the ball resulting in less spin. With topspin serves, energy is sent more through a spot above of the center of the ball resulting in more spin. Since energy is sent through the center of the ball, float serves will require less power than topspin serves. However, topspin serves are usually very effective. When served with topspin, the ball travels faster and the server is usually more accurate.  \n\n, To get a real grasp of how to create topspin, practice serving short by looping the ball high so it drops short over the net. The key here is to contact the ball back behind your head while keeping the hand in the cobra position.\n\n, Stand at the net on a platform or box and practice the volleyball arm swing. Self toss the ball and just focus on creating topspin. The goal is to get a feeling of how to create topspin and spike the ball down into the court. Progress to adding targets on the court.\n\n, The next step is to practice spiking from far off the net. Practice spiking from off the net because it's easier to contact the ball back behind your head when the set is off the net. Focus on getting comfortable getting your hand in the cobra position and creating topspin on your spikes. Progress to adding targets.\n\n, Remember, the tighter the ball is to the net, the more tempting it is to spike the ball flat without topspin. Always focus on creating topspin every time you spike.\n\n",

        "text":"Lower Silesia (; ; ; ; ; ; Silesian German: Niederschläsing; ) is the northwestern part of the historical and geographical region of Silesia; Upper Silesia is to the southeast.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Lower Silesia was part of Piast-ruled Poland. It was one of the leading regions of Poland, and its capital Wrocław was one of the main cities of the Polish Kingdom. Lower Silesia emerged as a distinctive region during the fragmentation of Poland, in 1172, when the Duchies of Opole and Racibórz, considered Upper Silesia since, were formed of the eastern part of the Duchy of Silesia, and the remaining, western part was since considered Lower Silesia. During the Ostsiedlung, German settlers were invited to settle in the sparsely populated region, which until then had a Polish majority. As a result, the region became largely Germanised in the following centuries.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages the region fell under the overlordship of the Bohemian Crown, however large parts remained under the rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty, some up to the 16th and 17th century. Briefly, under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Hungary, it fell to the Austrian Habsburg monarchy in 1526.\n\nIn 1742, Austria ceded nearly all of Lower Silesia to the Kingdom of Prussia in the Treaty of Berlin, except for the southern part of the Duchy of Nysa. Within the Prussian kingdom, the region became part of the Province of Silesia. In 1871, Lower Silesia was integrated into the German Empire. After World War I, the region became a separate province within the Weimar Republic.\n\nAfter 1945, the main part of the former Prussian province fell to the Republic of Poland, while a smaller part west of the Oder-Neisse line remained within East Germany and historical parts of Austrian Lower Silesia (Jesenicko, Opavsko regions) remained as a part of Czechoslovakia. By 1949, almost the entire pre-war German population was expelled. Poles displaced from the former Polish lands incorporated into the USSR settled in Lower Silesia after the war, as well as Polish settlers from other parts of Poland.\n\nThe region is known for an abundance of historic architecture of various styles, including many castles and palaces, well preserved or reconstructed old towns, numerous spa towns, and historic burial sites of Polish monarchs and consorts (in Wrocław, Legnica and Trzebnica).\n\nGeography \n\nLower Silesia is located mostly in the basin of the middle Oder River with its historic capital in Wrocław.\n\nThe southern border of Lower Silesia is mapped by the mountain ridge of the Western and Central Sudetes, which since the High Middle Ages formed the border between Polish Silesia and the historic Bohemian region of the present-day Czech Republic. The Bóbr and Kwisa rivers are considered being the original western border with the Lusatias, however, the Silesian Duchy of Żagań reached up to the Neisse river, including two villages (Pechern and Neudorf) on the western shore, which became Silesian in 1413.\n\nThe later Silesian Province of Prussia further comprised the adjacent lands of historic Upper Lusatia ceded by the Kingdom of Saxony after the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, its westernmost point could be found as far west as the small village of Lindenau (now belonging to the German state of Brandenburg). To the north, Lower Silesia originally stretched up to Świebodzin and Krosno Odrzańskie, which was acquired by the Margraves of Brandenburg in 1482. The Barycz river forms the border with historic Greater Poland in the northeast, the Upper Silesian lands lie to the southeast.\n\nAdministratively Polish Lower Silesia is shared between Lower Silesian Voivodeship (except for the Upper Lusatian counties of Lubań and Zgorzelec, and former Bohemian Kłodzko), the southern part of Lubusz Voivodeship (i.e. the counties of Krosno Odrzańskie, Nowa Sól, Świebodzin, Żagań and Zielona Góra with the city of Zielona Góra, as well as western Opole Voivodeship (the counties of Brzeg, Namysłów and Nysa).\n\nThe tiny part of the former Duchy of Żagań on the western shore of the Neisse is today part of the Krauschwitz municipality in the Görlitz district of Saxony, the larger Upper Lusatian parts of Prussian Silesia (\"Silesian Upper Lusatia\") west of the Neisse comprised the town of Görlitz and the former district of Hoyerswerda, which today forms the northern part of the Saxon Görlitz and Bautzen districts as well as the southern part of the Oberspreewald-Lausitz district in Brandenburg. The southern part of the former Duchy of Nysa, which fell to Austrian Silesia in 1742, namely the Jeseník District and Heřmanovice, Mnichov and Železná, as well as parts of Vrbno pod Pradědem in the Bruntál District, today belongs to the Czech Republic.\n\nSudetes \n\nThe Sudetes are a geologically diverse mountain range that stretches for  from the Lusatian Highlands in the west and to the Moravian Gate in the east. They are topographically divided into Western, Central and Eastern Sudetes.\n\nThe Lower Silesian section of the Sudetes comprises the Jizera Mountains (highest peak: Wysoka Kopa, ), where the tripoint with Upper Lusatia and Bohemia is located near the Smrk summit, along with the adjacent Karkonosze Krkonoše (, also known as in ) (highest: border peak of Sněžka Śnieżka – highest mountain of Czech Republic, ); Rudawy Janowickie (Skalnik, ); Owl Mountains (Wielka Sowa, ); Stone Mountains (Waligóra ); Wałbrzych Mountains (Borowa ) and the Kaczawskie Mountains (Skopiec, ) with Ostrzyca,  - they surround the Jelenia Góra valley, ; Ślęża Massif (Mount Ślęża ), massive of Orlické hory, Králický Sněžník south of historical Kladsko ), Rychlebské hory and Jeseníky (  (Praděd, ) .\n\nSilesian Lowland \nThe adjacent Silesian Lowland includes the Silesian Lowlands and the Silesian-Lusatian Lowlands. These two lowlands are separated with each other by Dolina Kaczawy, and from the Sudetes by a steep morphological edge located along the Sudeten Marginal Fault, extended from Bolesławiec (the Northwest) to Złoty Stok (the Southeast). The southern part of the Lowland includes The Sudeten Foreland, consisting of quite low Wzgórze Strzegomskie, , Grupa Ślęży (Mount Ślęża, ), and Wzgórza Niemczańsko-Strzelińskie (Gromnik Mountain, ). Lower hills occur also in areas of Obniżenie Sudeckie, Świdnik, and Kotlina Dzierżoniowska. The eastern part of Silesian Lowland consists of the wide Silesian Lowlands, located along banks of the Oder River. The eastern part includes also Równina Wrocławska with its surrounding lands: Równina Oleśnicka, Wysoczyzna Średzka, Równina Grodkowska and Niemodlińska. Dolina Dolnej Kaczawy (Kotlina Legnicka) separates the Silesian Lowlands from the Silesian-Lusatian Lowlands, which includes Wysoczyzna Lubińsko-Chocianowska, Dolina Szprotawy, and wide areas of Bory Dolnośląskie, located to the north from the Bolesławiec-Zgorzelec road. From the North, the lowlands are delimited by Wał Trzebnicki, consisting of hills that are  long and over  high, in comparison to neighboring lowlands, Kobyla Mountain, . The range of hills includes Wzgórza Dalkowskie, Wzgórza Trzebnickie, Wzgórza Twardogórskie, and Wzgórza Ostrzeszowskie. Obniżenie Milicko-Głogowskie, with Kotlina Żmigrodzka and Milicka, is located in the northern part, within the hills.\n\nThe region of the lowlands is coated with a thick layer of glacial elements (sand, gravel, clay) that covers more diverse relief of the older ground. Generally flat and wide bottoms of the valleys are padded with river settlements. Slopes of the hills over  are coated with fertile clays and therefore, to begin with, the Paleozoic era, they became the lands for people to settle and cultivate intensively. The later form of the economy caused almost complete deforestation of the slopes. Not only fertile grounds, but also the mild climate is conductive to the development of agriculture and market gardening. The annual average temperature of the Wrocław area is . The average temperature of the hottest month (July) is , and  of the coldest month (January). The average amount of rainfall is , with its maximum in July and minimum in February. The snow layer disappears after 45 days. The winds, similar to those appearing in the West side of Poland, are West and Southwest.\n\nSudeten rivers are characterized by changeable water rates, and high pollution resulting from large industrialization of the area. The greatest rivers are Nysa Kłodzka, which is the source of drinking water for Wrocław (the water is drawn by special channel); Stobrawa, Oława, Ślęza, Bystrzyca with its tributaries—Strzegomka and Piława; Widawa, Średzka Woda, Kaczawa with Nysa Szalona and Czarna Woda. There is also the largest right-bank tributary of the area, Barycz. The other quite large rivers, Bóbr, Kwisa, and Lusatian Neisse, flow into the Oder River beyond Lower Silesian borders. The majority of the rivers is regulated and their basins are improved, which is conductive to the proper water economy. The characteristic feature of the landscape of the lowland is the lack of lakes. The region of Legnica is the only place where a dozen or so of small lakes survived, but the majority of them is already disappearing. The largest one is Jezioro Kunickie (), Jezioro Koskowickie (), Jezioro Jaśkowickie () and Tatarak (). In contrast to the number of lakes, there are large groups of artificial ponds founded in the Barycz basin, in the Middle Ages. Their total area amounts around , and the largest ponds (Stary Staw, Łosiowy Staw, Staw Niezgoda, Staw Mewi Duży, and Grabownica) come to .\n\nThe primeval flora has been transformed significantly as a result of deforestation and cultivation. The largest forest complexes are Bory Dolnośląskie (), Bory Stobrawskie in Stobrawa and Widawa areas, and smaller fragments of forests in Barycz and Oder River valleys. These forests are kind of multi-species deciduous forests, occurring in fertile grounds. The Oder River valley is reach in groups of mixed forests (beech, oak, hornbeam, sycamore maple, and pine). These forests, with protected status, are: Zwierzyniec, Kanigóra near Oława, Dublany, Kępa Opatowicka near Wrocław, Zabór near Przedmoście, and Lubiąż. The other forest areas are The Natural Park in Orsk, the areas of Jodłowice, Wzgórze Joanny near Milicz, and Gola near Twardogóra. Such types of forest like those  which are the mainstay for wild game or nurseries, are inaccessible because of permanent fire hazard. Territories partly accessible (marked specially) are located in areas of Góra Śląska, Oborniki Śląskie, Wołowa, in the Oder River valley, and in Wzgórza Niemczańsko-Strzelińskie.\n\nFlora \nThe flora of Lower Silesia is specific and different for each zone. From the bottoms to the top, plants form groups that are arranged in wide or narrow belts, called floral zones. Subsequently, these zones are divided into narrower belts, called vegetation belts.\n\nThe zone of mountain forest is divided into two belts: subalpine and lower subalpine forest. Above, there is a forestless zone divided into the subalpine belt with dwarf pine, and the alpine belt without shrubs. This vegetation is glacial; the former vegetation—from the Tertiary—was destroyed by the climate of the Ice Age. Along with glaciation from the North, some tundra plants appeared, for example downy willow (Salix lapponum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus). The flora of Lower Silesia is strongly influenced by geological and climatic history. The vegetation is formed by species deriving from various geographic regions. Particular regions are represented by:\n\n Central European species: fir (Abies alba), beech (Fagus silvatica), oak (Quercus petraea), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus)\n European Syberian species: European spindle-tree (Evonymus europaea), alder (Alnus glutinosa), wicker (Salix purpurea)\n Boreal-Sub arctic species: cress (Cardamine pratensis), yellow marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), liverleaf (Hepatica nobilis)\n Boreal-Arctic species: bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), dwarf willow (Salix herbacea), black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), Sudetic Lousewort (Pedicularis sudetica), alpine saxifrage (Micranthes nivalis), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), lake quillwort (Isoëtes lacustris)\n Alpine species: Alpine bastard toadflax (Thesium alpinium), Alpine coltsfoot (Homogyne alpina), mountain avens (Geum montanum), mountain pine (Pinus mugo)\n Sudetic and Sudetic-Carpathian species: mossy saxifrage (Saxifraga moschata ssp. Basaltica), Sudetic lousewort (Pedicularis sudetica)\n\nLower subalpine forest \nLower subalpine forest (), , is characterized by deciduous or mixed forest. The fragments of forests similar to natural complexes of pine-fir-beech with admixture of larch, sycamore maple and lime occur near the Szklarski waterfall, in the Jagniątkowski complex, and Chojnik Mountain. Particular species of trees have different climatic requirements. The lowest parts are covered with oak and ash, up to . On the level of 500– occurs pine; in the higher parts, up to , there occurs European larch; and above 800 m, fir and beech.\n\nDespite transformation of the basic tree vegetation, the same form of undergrowth survived. There occurs: daphne mezereum, red elderberry, hazel, platanthera bifolia, sweet woodruff, Herb Paris, cranberry, wood sorrel, chickweed wintergreen, Common Cow-wheat and lily of the valley. The parts over 800 m are mainly covered with grasses, purple small-reeds, cranberries, and willow gentian.\n\nIn highlighted places, on meadows, and along roads, there occurs: spotted orchid, bugleweed, yellow archangel, arnica montana, sword-leaved helleborine, rosebay willowherb, groundsel, and foxglove. Along riversides, there occurs white butterbur.\n\nPine forests are rich in spruces, which are permanently weakened by atmospheric factors. Frayed roots are easily infected by harmful fungus and insects. The most damaging is honey mushroom, with edible specimen, which grows in pulp, between the bark and timber, causing the death of tree. The other damaging fungus is bracket fungus, which destroys roots and trunks from the inside. The honey mushroom devastates the tree within a few months, and the bracket fungus, within a few years, as a result of mechanic changes in wood structure.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient history \nAt the close of the Ice Age, the first man appeared at the Silesian Lowland. In the Mesolithic (7,000 years ago), the first nomadic people settled in Lower Silesia, living in caves and primitive chalets. They were collectors, hunters, and fishers, and used weapons and other tools made of stone and wood. In the Upper Paleolithic, the oldest human remains of the nomadic people, which were 40,000 years old, were found in a tomb in Tyniec on the river Ślęża.\n\nIn the Neolithic (4000–1700 BC), began the process of transformation into a settled way of life. The first rural settlements were made, as people began to farm and breed animals. Mining, pottery, and weaving are dated to this period. Serpentinite quarries came into existence, of which Silesian hatchets were made, and near Jordanów Śląski, people extracted nephrite that was transformed into diverse tools. In the Bronze Age (1700–1500 BC), the evolution of different cultures developed to the existence of Unetice culture that affected the existence of Trzciniec culture. In the next periods since , it encompasses all of Europe.\n\nEarly history \nIn the La Tène culture period, Lower Silesia was inhabited by the Celts, who had their main place of cult on the Mount Ślęża. Their stony statues situated on and around this hill were later worshipped by the Slavic tribes that came here around the sixth century AD. Magna Germania (second century) records that between the Celtic and the Slavic period, Lower Silesia was inhabited by a number of Germanic tribes. Among them, are the Vandals, the Lugii, and the Silingi, who might have given the Silesia region its name, though it is unclear and thus disputed. With the Germanic tribes leaving westward during the Migration Period, a number of new peoples arrived in Silesia from Sarmatia, Asia Minor, and the Asian steppes from the beginning of the sixth century.\n\nThe Bavarian Geographer () referred to the West Slavic Ślężanie (the other possible source of the region's Śląsk and later Silesia name), centered on Niemcza, and Dziadoszanie tribes, while a 1086 document issued by Bishop Jaromir of Prague listed the Zlasane, Trebovane, Poborane, and Dedositze. At the same time, Upper Silesia was inhabited by the Opolanie, Lupiglaa, and Golenshitse tribes. In the late 9th century, the territory was subject to the Great Moravian realm of Prince Svatopluk I and from about 906 came under the rule of the Přemyslid duke Spytihnev I of Bohemia and his successors Vratislaus I, the alleged founder of Wrocław (), and Boleslaus the Cruel.\n\nPiast Kingdom of Poland \n\nMeanwhile, the West Slavic Polans had established the first duchy under the Piast dynasty in the adjacent Greater Polish lands in the north. About 990 Silesia was conquered and incorporated into the first Polish state by the Piast duke Mieszko I, who had gained the support of Emperor Otto II against the Bohemian duke Boleslaus II.\n\nIn 1000 his son and successor Bolesław I Chrobry founded the Diocese of Wrocław, which, together with the Bishoprics of Kraków and Kołobrzeg, was placed under the Archbishopric of Gniezno in Greater Poland, founded by Emperor Otto III at the Congress of Gniezno in the same year. The ecclesial suzerainty of Gniezno over Wrocław lasted until 1821. After a temporary shift to Bohemia in the first half of the 11th century, Lower Silesia continued to be an integral part of the Polish state until the end of its fragmentation period when all Polish claims on this land were finally renounced in favor of the Bohemian kingdom in 1348.\n\nVarious Polish defensive battles against the invading Germans took place in the region in the Middle Ages, including the victorious battles of Niemcza in 1017 and Głogów and Psie Pole in 1109. In the early 12th century, Wrocław was named one of the three major cities of the Polish Kingdom alongside Kraków and Sandomierz in the oldest Polish chronicle, Gesta principum Polonorum. One of the largest battles of medieval Poland, the Battle of Legnica, during the first Mongol invasion of Poland was fought in the region 1241.\n\nAlso a leading region of medieval Poland. The first-ever granting of town privileges in Polish history, happened there, when Złotoryja was granted such rights in 1211 by Henry the Bearded, and in the 13th century the Book of Henryków, a chronicle containing the oldest known text in Polish, was created in the region.\n\nThe Duchy of Silesia was first split into lower and upper parts in 1172 during the period of Poland's feudal fragmentation, when the land was divided between two sons of former High Duke Władysław II. The elder Bolesław the Tall ruled over Lower Silesia with his capital in Wrocław (then known as Vratislav, Wrotizla, or Prezla), and younger Mieszko Tanglefoot ruled over Upper Silesia with his capital at first in Racibórz, from 1202 in Opole. Later Silesia was divided into as many as 17 duchies. Main duchies of Lower Silesia:\n Silesia–Wrocław\n Legnica, split off in 1248\n Brzeg, split off from Legnica in 1311\n Świdnica-Jawor, split off from Legnica in 1274\n Ziębice, split off from Świdnica in 1321\n Głogów, split off from Legnica in 1251\n Żagań, split off from Głogów in 1274\/1278\n Oleśnica, split off from Głogów in 1313\n Bierutów, split off from Oleśnica in 1412\n Krosno-Ścinawa\n Nysa, established in 1290\n\nPolish duchies, Bohemian Crown, Hungary, Austria, and Prussia \n\nWith the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin (Trenčín) and the 1348 Treaty of Namysłów, most of the Silesian duchies were ruled by the Silesian Piast dukes under the feudal overlordship of the Bohemian kings, and thus became part of the Crown of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire. Many duchies remained Polish-ruled under the houses of Piast, Jagiellon and Sobieski, some up to the 17th and 18th century. In 1469, Lower Silesia passed to Hungary, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty. In 1476, the Crossen district became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when the widow of the Piast ruler, Barbara von Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles, inherited Crossen. It remained an important center of Polish culture. In 1475 Głogów-born Polish printer  founded the  (Holy Cross Printing House) in Wrocław, which published the , the first incunable in Lower Silesia, which also contains the first-ever text printed in the Polish language.\n\nIn 1526 Silesia was acquired by Austria's Habsburg monarchy after the death of King Louis II of Bohemia. Brandenburg contested the inheritance, citing a treaty made with Frederick II of Legnica, but Silesia largely remained under Habsburg control until 1742. In 1675 Duke George William of Legnica died at the Brzeg Castle, as the last male member of the Piast dynasty, which founded the Polish state in the 10th century. He was buried in Legnica.\n\nMost of Lower Silesia, except for the southern part of the Duchy of Nysa, became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after the First Silesian War by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau. In 1815, it became part of the Prussian Silesia Province, which was divided into the two Lower Silesian administrative regions (Regierungsbezirke) of Liegnitz and Breslau (sometimes also referred to as Middle Silesia), and Upper Silesian Oppeln (including the Lower Silesian districts of Neisse and Grottkau). The western Liegnitz region had been enlarged by the incorporation of the Upper Lusatian districts of Lauban, Görlitz, Rothenburg and Hoyerswerda, all seized from the Kingdom of Saxony after the Napoleonic Wars. From 1871, Lower Silesia was part of the German Empire.\n\nAs a result of long lasting German colonization and Germanisation, by the beginning of the 20th century Lower Silesia had a majority German-speaking population, with the exception of a small Polish-speaking area in the northeastern part of the district of Namslau (Namysłów), Groß Wartenberg (Syców) and Militsch (Milicz) and a Czech-speaking minority in the rural area around Strehlen (Strzelin). There were also Polish communities in large cities such as Breslau (Wrocław) and Grünberg (Zielona Góra). After the First World War, the bulk of Lower Silesia remained within Germany, the Bohemian part was included within Czechoslovakia, and a small part was reintegrated with Poland, which just regained independence. The German part was re-organized into the Province of Lower Silesia of the Free State of Prussia consisting of the Breslau and Liegnitz regions. In the interwar period, there were multiple instances of anti-Polish violence in the German part, and already in 1920 a Polish consulate in Wrocław was attacked and demolished by German nationalists. In the 1930s Poles and Jews were increasingly persecuted in the German-controlled part of the region.\n\nWorld War II\n\nDuring World War II the Germans established the Gross-Rosen concentration camp with around 100 subcamps in the region, in which around 125,000 people of various nationalities, among them mostly Jews, Poles and citizens of the Soviet Union, were imprisoned, and around 40,000 died. Also several German prisoner-of-war camps, including Stalag VIII-A, Stalag VIII-C, Stalag VIII-E, Stalag Luft III, Oflag VIII-B, Oflag VIII-F, with numerous forced labour subcamps were located in the region, as well as various subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B\/344 POW camp. POWs of various nationalities were held in those camps, including Poles, Frenchmen, Belgians, Britons, Italians, Canadians, Americans, Greeks, Yugoslavians, Russians, Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Norwegians, Lithuanians, Slovaks, etc. In the final stages of the war it was the site of several death marches perpetrated by Nazi Germany.\n\nIn view of Polish claims to the area, a memorandum prepared by the United States Department of State in May 1945 recommended that the area stay with Germany because there was \"no historic or ethnic justification\" for granting this land to Poland.\n\nHowever, according to Soviet insistence at the Potsdam Agreement, in which the Soviet Union annexed most of the eastern Poland, Lower Silesia went to the Republic of Poland. These border shifts were agreed on pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place. Germany retained the small portion of the former Prussian Province of Lower Silesia to the west of the Oder-Neisse line.\n\nModern Poland \nThe remaining German population was expelled from the bulk of Lower Silesia east of the Neisse in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Poles from Central Poland and the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union came to the region.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1975 Lower Silesia was administered within the Wrocław Voivodeship. As a result of the Local Government Reorganisation Act (1975), Poland's administration was reorganized into 49 voivodeships, four of them in Lower Silesia: Jelenia Góra, Legnica, Wałbrzych, and Wrocław Voivodeships (1975–1998). As a result of the Local Government Reorganisation Act of 1998, these four provinces were joined into the Lower Silesian Voivodeship (effective 1 January 1999), whose capital is Wrocław.\n\nPopulation\nAt the close of the classical period the region was inhabited by Germanic Tribes, who during the Migration Period moved westward to the lands of modern Germany and France and were replaced in Lower Silesia by Lechitic tribes. Centuries later, German settlers came to Lower Silesia during the Late Middle Ages, attracted by newly founded towns to develop the region. Over time, the autochthonous Polish population became partly Germanised and took up the German language as well, however, notable Polish communities survived, especially in northern Lower Silesia, and in larger cities. In year 1819, the Breslau Regency had 833,253 inhabitants, the majority of whom—755,553 (90%)—were German-speakers; with a Polish-speaking minority numbering 66,500 (8%); as well as 3,900 Czechs (1%) and 7,300 Jews (1%). U.S. Immigration Commission in 1911 classified Polish-speaking Silesians as ethnic Poles. After World War II, German inhabitants that had not fled the area due to the war, were expelled, and the region was resettled by Poles from former eastern Poland, which was annexed by the Soviet Union, as well as from other regions, making Polish minority majority again. In 1948–1954 Greeks and Macedonians, refugees of the Greek Civil War, came to Lower Silesia. They were temporarily admitted in five towns and villages in the region and afterwards finally settled in various cities and counties, although in the next decades some returned to Greece, and some emigrated to other countries. The largest Greek-Macedonian communities were located in Zgorzelec, Wrocław, Świdnica and Wałbrzych.\n\nCities and towns \n\nTowns with over 20,000 inhabitants:\n Wrocław\n Zielona Góra\n Wałbrzych\n Legnica\n Jelenia Góra\n Lubin\n Głogów\n Świdnica\n Bolesławiec\n Nowa Sól\n Oleśnica\n Brzeg\n Dzierżoniów\n Oława\n Bielawa\n Żagań\n Jawor\n Świebodzice\n Polkowice\n Nowa Ruda\n Świebodzin\n Jelcz-Laskowice\n\nSilesian traditions in Upper Lusatia \n\nEastern parts of Upper Lusatia also formed part of Silesia in the early 14th century, as part of the Duchy of Jawor of fragmented Poland, and again from 1815 to 1945, when the area was annexed from Saxony by Prussia and included within the Province of Silesia and later of Lower Silesia. During this time Silesian culture and the Silesian German dialect spread into this region with its centre Görlitz. The expulsion of the Germans from the east of the Oder-Neisse line led to an additional settlement of German Silesians in this region.\n\nDue to these facts, some of the inhabitants of this region still consider themselves Silesian and cultivate Silesian customs. One of their special privileges is the right to use the Lower Silesian flag and coat of arms which is guaranteed to them by the Saxon Constitution of 1992. The Evangelical Church of Silesia in Upper Lusatia, meanwhile, merged with the one of Berlin and Brandenburg to form the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia.\n\nTowns \nThe main cities within the former province of Lower Silesia west of the Oder-Neisse line are (Upper Sorbian names in italics):\n\n Görlitz (Zhorjelc)\n Hoyerswerda (Wojerecy)\n Weißwasser\/O.L. (Běła Woda)\n Niesky (Niska)\n\nThe main Lusatian cities within the former Duchy of Jawor and province of Lower Silesia east of Lusatian Neisse, now within Lower Silesian Voivodship are:\n Zgorzelec (formerly part of Görlitz)\n Lubań\n Bogatynia\n\nTourism \n\nThe international airport is located in Wrocław – Wrocław – Copernicus Airport.\n\nThe A4 motorway and A18 motorway run through Lower Silesia.\n\nLower Silesia is one of the most visited regions in Poland. It is famous for a large number of castles and palaces (more than 100), inter alia: Książ Castle, Czocha Castle, Grodziec Castle, Gola Dzierżoniowska Castle, Oleśnica Castle, Kamieniec Ząbkowicki Palace. There is also a lot in the Jelenia Góra valley.\n\nThe most widely visited city is Wrocław where the Festival of Good Beer is held every year on the second weekend of June.\n\nOther highlights:\nKłodzko Fortress, Fort Srebrna Góra, Project Riese, Wambierzyce, Legnickie Pole, Oleśnica Mała, Lubiąż Abbey, Krzeszów, Henryków, Vang Stave Church, Churches of Peace, Mount Ślęża, Table Mountains, Owl Mountains, Karkonosze, Main Sudetes Trail (440 km from Świeradów Zdrój to Prudnik), Barycz Valley Landscape Park.\n\nSport \n\nAmong the most accomplished sports clubs in Lower Silesia are football clubs Śląsk Wrocław and Zagłębie Lubin, speedway clubs Falubaz Zielona Góra and Sparta Wrocław, basketball clubs Śląsk Wrocław, Basket Zielona Góra, Górnik Wałbrzych and handball club Śląsk Wrocław.\n\nEvery year in September, Wrocław Marathon is organized.\n\nSee also \n\n Koleje Dolnośląskie\n Izera railway\n Silesia Walls\n Chrobry fortified village in Szprotawa\n Project Riese\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n Urbanek M., (2003), Dolny Śląsk.

        "text":"  (abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high mass\naccretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised\naccretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in\nterms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models\nrequire that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model\nuses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in\nabsorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic\ndriving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that\nwhile both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the\nabsorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are\nsoft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass\naccretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are\nconsistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,\nwith NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while\nthe broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high\/soft state. We also\nuse the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion\npower which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does\nnot always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of\nthe total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an\nartifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in\nour fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is often\nobserved to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect in\nNLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectral\nstate and AGN type.\n",

        "text":"The Victoria Cross (VC) was awarded to 15 recipients for action during the New Zealand Wars. The VC is a military decoration awarded for valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of armed forces of some Commonwealth countries and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals; it may be awarded to a person of any rank in any service and to civilians under military command. The award was officially constituted when Queen Victoria issued a warrant under the Royal sign-manual on 29 January 1856, which was gazetted on 5 February 1856. The order was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour during the Crimean War.\n\nOriginally, the VC was not available to colonial troops, even if under British command, but this changed in 1867. The extension was made following a recommendation for gallantry regarding colonial soldier Major Charles Heaphy for action in the land wars in 1864. He was operating under British command and the VC was gazetted in 1867. Later that year, the Government of New Zealand assumed full responsibility for operations but no further recommendations for the Victoria Cross were raised for local troops who distinguished themselves in action. Following gallant actions by three New Zealand soldiers in November 1868 and January 1869 during the land wars, an Order in Council on 10 March 1869 created a \"Distinctive Decoration\" for members of the local forces without seeking permission from the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Although the Governor was chided for exceeding his authority, the Order in Council was ratified by the Queen. The title \"Distinctive Decoration\" was later replaced by the title New Zealand Cross.\n\nThe New Zealand Wars were a series of conflicts that took place in New Zealand between 1845 and 1872. The two conflicts where soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross were the First Taranaki War of 1860–1861 and the Waikato-Hauhau Māori War of 1863–1866. The First Taranaki War was fought over land rights on New Zealand's North Island. The local Colonial Governor had set up a policy whereby the British Government could buy local land, and anyone refusing to sell their land would be committing treason against the Crown. When the Te Atiawa refused to sell their land, the British Army attacked on 17 March 1860, starting the First Taranaki War. After a series of sieges by the British, a truce was signed with the Māori people in March 1861; the disputed land became British-owned territory but it remained in possession of the Māori people. The First Taranaki War ended in a stalemate over the one area of disputed land. By 1863 the influx of settlers and consequent demand for land led to further conflict. In July 1863, the British Army and the Auckland Militia launched the Invasion of Waikato against the forces of Tāwhiao and the Māori King Movement. The British expelled the Māori people from their lands, swiftly moving south, culminating in the defeat and flight of Tāwhiao at Ōrākau in March 1864. The British pursued him across the country as far as the fourth Waikato defensive line, which later became the border of King Country.\n\nRecipients\n\nFurther reading\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nVictoria Cross: Awards to Imperial Servicemen during the 2nd Maori War\nHeroes of The Maori Wars (1934 article)\n\nVictoria Cross recipients\n\nMilitary awards and decorations of New Zealand\nLists of recipients of the Victoria Cross by conflict\nWaka",

        "text":"Subramanian Swamy (born 15 September 1939) is an Indian politician, economist and statistician. Before joining politics, he was a professor of Mathematical Economics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. He is known for his Hindu nationalist views. Swamy was a member of the Planning Commission of India and was a Cabinet Minister in the Chandra Shekhar government. Between 1994 and 1996, Swamy was Chairman of the Commission on Labour Standards and International Trade under former Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. Swamy was a long-time member of the Janata Party, serving as its president until 2013 when he joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He has written on foreign affairs of India dealing largely with China, Pakistan and Israel. He was nominated to Rajya Sabha on 26 April 2016 for a six-year term, ending on 24 April 2022.\n\nFamily and education\nSubramanian Swamy was born on 15 September 1939, in Mylapore, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, to a family which hailed originally from Madurai in Tamil Nadu in a Tamil Brahmin family.  His father, Sitaraman Subramanian, was a bureaucrat and his mother, Padmavathi, was a homemaker. He has one younger brother, Ram Subramanian, as well as two younger sisters.\n\nSitaraman Subramanian was an officer in the Indian Statistical Service who served as the director of the Central Statistical Institute in Delhi, and was a statistical adviser to the Government of India. The family, which hailed from Madurai in Tamil Nadu, moved to New Delhi when Swamy was only six months old. Due to his father's job and the family's Tamil roots, major national leaders like K. Kamaraj, C. Rajagopalachari and S. Satyamurti often visited Sitaraman.\n\nEducation \nHe attended Hindu College, University of Delhi, from where he earned his bachelor's degree in Mathematics. He then took his master's degree in Statistics from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. He was later recommended by Hendrik S. Houthakker and went to study at Harvard University on a full Rockefeller scholarship, where he received his PhD in Economics in 1965, with his thesis titled Economic Growth and Income Distribution in a Developing Nation. His thesis adviser was Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets. While he was a doctoral student at Harvard, he attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a cross-registered student and later worked at the United Nations Secretariat in New York City as an Assistant Economics Affairs Officer in 1963. He subsequently worked as a resident tutor at Lowell House at Harvard University.\n\nFamily and personal life\nSwamy met Roxna Kapadia, whose father was member of Indian Civil Service (British India) and an Indian lady of Parsi ethnicity who was studying PhD in mathematics at Harvard University. They were married in June 1966. Swamy has two daughters. The elder daughter, Gitanjali Swamy, is an entrepreneur and private equity professional. She is married to Sanjay Sarma, a professor at MIT, who is the son of E.A.S Sarma, a retired IAS officer and former secretary of Economic Affairs to the government of India. The younger daughter, Suhasini Haidar, is a print and television journalist married to Nadeem Haidar, the son of former Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haidar.\n\nAcademic career\nIn July 1965, immediately after obtaining his PhD in economics from Harvard, Swamy joined the Department of Economics at the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences as an assistant professor. in 1969, he was made an associate professor. As an associate professor, he was invited by Amartya Sen to occupy the chair on Chinese studies at the Delhi School of Economics. He accepted the offer and even travelled to India to take up the position, but his appointment was cancelled at the last minute due to his views on India's economic policy and also its nuclear policy. at that time, India was still partially oriented towards socialism and the \"command economy\" model instituted by Nehru, and Swamy was a believer in market economy.\n\nThereafter, Swamy moved to the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi where he was a full Professor of Mathematical Economics there from 1969 to the early 1970s. He was removed from the position by its board of governors in the early 1970s because of his disapproval of Indira Gandhi's poor economic policies but was legally reinstated in the late 1990s by the Supreme Court of India. He continued in the position until 1991 when he resigned to become a cabinet minister. He served on the Board of Governors of the IIT, Delhi (1977–80) and on the Council of IITs (1980–82). He also taught economics courses at Harvard Summer School until 2011, when the Harvard faculty voted to eliminate Swamy's courses as a result of his \"offensive\" statements about Muslims.\n\nSwamy currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the SCMS Group of Institutions, which includes the SCMS Cochin School of Business in Kochi.\n\nPolitical career\n\nEarly politics\nSwamy's career started with his involvement in the Sarvodaya movement, which was an apolitical movement but which formed the foundation of the creation of Janata Party later. The real turn in his political career came after his sacking from IIT. Liberal economic policies put forward by him did not go well with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who sneered at his plans as 'Santa Claus with unrealistic ideas'. He was later expelled from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. This marked the beginning of his active political career. As a staunch opponent of Indira Gandhi, the opposition part, Bharatiya Jana Sangh sent him to Rajya Sabha – the upper house of Indian Parliament.\n\nHe was an elected Member of Lok sabha, the lowe house of Indian   Parliament five times between 1974 and 1999. As a Lok Sabha member, he  represented the city of Mumbai North East twice (1977 and 1980) and later the city of Madurai (1998). As a Rajya Sabha member, herepresented Uttar Pradesh (1974) in the Parliament.\n\nDuring Emergency (1975 – 1977) \nDuring the period of the Emergency, he fled to the United States, seeking haven with an Indian businessman in Michigan who had become the spokesperson of the opposition in the United States. In 1976, when the Emergency was still in force and an arrest warrant had been issued in his name, Swamy came to Parliament to attend the session and managed to escape India after the session was adjourned. This act of defiance was well received in the eyes of opposition parties.\n\nIn Janata Party \nIn 1981, he along with Harish Rawat and 13 others led first pilgrimage to Kailash–Manasarovar after 1962 Sino-Indian War. In 1984, Swamy stated his opinion that Janata Party should focus on organisational levels of the party. In February 1984, he filed his nomination for Janata Party President against Chandra Shekhar, but lost. In the same year, 1984, Swamy was expelled from Janata Party after he levelled allegations against Chandra Shekhar that Shekhar had manipulated the Janata Party presidency election. Subsequently, he joined Lok Dal, party of former Prime Minister Charan Singh. He fought 1984 Lok Sabha election from Mumbai North East Lok Sabha constituency on Lok Dal ticket, but lost.\n\nIn May 1988, Lok Dal (A) was merged with Janata Party with Ajit Singh as its president and Swamy became general secretary of Janata Party. Later in October 1988, Janata Dal was formed by merging major opposition parties with Janata Party one of its constituent. But Swamy along with Indubhai Patel, H. D. Deve Gowda, Syed Shahabuddin, Sarojini Mahishi refused to accept the merger of Janata Party into Janata Dal and remained in Janata Party. In December 1990, he was elected as president of Janata Party by Central Parliamentary Board.\n\nElectoral history \n 197476Member of Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, elected on a Jan Sangh party ticket\n 197780Member of Lok Sabha from Mumbai North-East, elected on a Janata Party ticket\n 198084Member of Lok Sabha from Mumbai North-East, elected on a Janata Party ticket\n 198894Member of Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, elected on a Janata Party ticket\n 199899Member of Lok Sabha from Madurai, elected on a Janata Party ticket\n 2016–22Member of Rajya Sabha, Nominated Category\n\nMinister of Commerce and Law of India (1990–1991) \nDuring 1990 and 1991, Swamy served as a member of the Planning Commission of India and as Cabinet Minister of Commerce and Law. On 27 December 1990, Financial Times published an interview of Swamy by David Housego in which he claimed that the decision to raise import duties by his government is a \"panic reaction\". In Parliament Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar claimed that Swamy had denied what had been attributed to him in the article, but David Housego who wrote the story stood firmly by it.\n\nLater years\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, Swamy was chairman of the Commission on Labour Standards and International Trade (equivalent in rank to a cabinet minister) under Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. In 1997, he filed a petition against P. Chidambaram in Delhi High Court, which alleged that Chidambaram had violated Prevention of Corruption Act while purchasing shares of Fairgrowth Financial Services Limited in 1991. But in 1998, Delhi High Court dismissed his petition under technical grounds.\n\nDuring 1998 general election, Swamy formed an alliance with J. Jayalalithaa's AIADMK and won from Madurai constituency. One year later, on 29 March 1999, Swamy organised a tea party to bring various opposition leaders together. This meeting was attended by various leaders like Chandra Shekhar, P. V. Narasimha Rao, H. D. Deve Gowda, J. Jayalalithaa, Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi etc. This led to AIADMK's withdrawal from NDA coalition government and the government lost the majority in the Lok Sabha.\n\nOn 11 October 2004, Swamy along with Chandra Shekhar and George Fernandes formed Rashtriya Swabhiman Manch to oppose Sonia Gandhi and policies adopted by UPA government. He continued to be president of the Janata Party till 2013. On 11 August 2013, Swamy officially joined the BJP when its president was Rajnath Singh. His admission to the party would mark the merger of the Janata Party with the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nCourt petitions\n\nComplaint against Jayalalithaa\nIn 1996, Swamy had filed a criminal complaint against Jayalalithaa which led to her prosecution, conviction and sentencing to four years imprisonment by the trial court in 2014. Later, on 11 May 2015, a special Bench of the Karnataka High Court set aside the trial court order convicting former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha, who was acquitted of all charges in the disproportionate assets case. An Appeal against the High court verdict was filed in Supreme Court. The final verdict of Supreme Court came in February 2017 that indicted Jayalalitha posthumously and upheld the trial court judgement in toto.\n\nPhone tapping allegation\n\nSwamy released a letter alleging that former intelligence chief had asked DoT to tap the phone of many politicians and businessmen in Karnataka when Ramakrishna Hegde, the then Chief Minister, resigned in 1988. Hegde then filed a case against him in 1989 and 1990.\n\nHashimpura massacre\n\nIn 1987, when Muslim youths were killed under police custody, Swamy spoke against it and sat on a fast for more than a week in Jantar Mantar demanding the institution of an inquiry. After 25 years he started pursuing the case once again in court.\n\nRebecca John, a counsel for the Hashimpura complainants, told Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Siddhartha who is conducting the trial in the case, that \"there is no other motive than politics behind Swamy's plea for further investigation and it would only further delay the trial\".\n\nRole in exposing 2G spectrum case\n\nIn November 2008, Swamy amongst others wrote the first of five letters to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking permission to prosecute A. Raja in regard to 2G spectrum case. After not receiving any response, Swamy decided to file a case on his own in the Supreme Court of India regarding the matter, which then asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to produce a detailed report on it. He further called on the Indian government to re-auction the 2G spectrum without the involvement of Communications Minister Kapil Sibal.\n\nOn 15 April 2011, he filed a 206-page petition with PM Singh seeking permission to prosecute Sonia Gandhi on charges of corruption. He also raised doubts regarding her acquisition of Indian citizenship. Swamy filed documents in the court to prosecute Minister of Home Affairs P. Chidambaram by including a 15 January 2008 letter written by Chidambaram to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Swamy also placed on record the certified copy of the minutes of a meeting between Chidambaram, Raja and the prime minister during the tenure of Raja as the MOC&IT. Since criminal charges were filed against the accused, but no evidence was given by Swamy or the CBI, all the respondents have got bail as of July 2012.\n\nSanction to prosecute telecom minister A. Raja\nOn 31 January 2012, the Supreme Court of India accepted Swamy's petition against the Prime Minister's Office in the 2G case, saying that all public authorities should give a sanction within three months against any public official if a request is made for prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court said that Swamy had the locus standi to seek sanction from the Prime Minister for the prosecution of A. Raja in the 2G case. Sanction by a competent authority for the prosecution of a public servant has to be granted within a time frame, the apex court said. Justice AK Ganguly said that the sanction would be deemed to be granted if competent authority failed to take a decision within four months.\n\nSwamy's arguments were that he wrote to the PMO on 29 November 2008, but it was only on 19 March 2010 the PMO replied that the plea made by Swamy was \"premature\" as investigation was being carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Raja was arrested by the CBI in the case and got bail on 15 May 2012 after spending nearly 15 months in the Tihar Central Jail.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the special CBI Court Judge acquitted the accused including A. Raja.\n\nPetition to strike down \"single directive provision\" \nIn 1997, Swamy filed a petition in the Supreme Court of India to strike down a provision which barred CBI from investigating corruption charges against officers of the rank of joint secretary and above without prior permission of the Government of India called as \"Dr. Subramanian Swamy Versus Director, Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr.\" on 6 May 2014, a five-judge constitution bench held the single directive provision as invalid and unconstitutional. The court said that \"Protection of prior approval for probing graft charges against officers at level of joint secretary and above has propensity of shielding corruption.\" Incumbent CBI Director Ranjit Sinha welcomed the judgement and said, \"now a very heavy responsibility has been cast upon us to ensure that no innocent civil-servant is harassed.\"\n\nInvestigation on EVM\n\nSwamy demanded that an independent committee should be formed to check the security and safety of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) to avoid any rigging or tampering. He demanded that a printed receipt should be given to every voter after casting the vote. His PIL to investigate the working of EVM was dismissed by the Delhi High Court on 17 January 2012. The court refused to give any direction to the Election Commission to bring back paper-ballot system or use of printed receipts. The Commission argued that the use of paper is not feasible due to the huge size of Indian electorate. The court further asked the Election Commission to \"immediately begin a process of wider consultations\" and the Parliament \"to go into this question in depth and decide\".\n\nOn 22 January 2013 the Election Commission informed the Supreme Court that it would include Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system which is in the testing phase after the court agreed with some points raised by Swamy who was the contender, in the machines so that every voter will come to know who he\/she is voting by getting a printed slip after pressing the EVM button. The voter paper audit trail has then been in use from 4 September 2013.\n\nOn 8 October 2013 the Supreme Court directed the Election Commission to implement audit trail system in 2014 general election in phases.\n\nNational Herald case \n\nOn 1 November 2012 Swamy alleged that both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have committed fraud and land grabbing to a tune of  by acquiring a public ltd company called Associated Journals Private Ltd (AJPL) through their owned private company, Young Indian which was formed on 23 November 2010. Through this they had got publication rights of National Herald and Qaumi Awaz newspapers, with real estate properties in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. The acquired place was intended only for newspaper purposes but were used for running a passport office, amounting to crores of rupees, it alleges. Swamy further added that Rahul Gandhi hid the facts in his affidavit while filing nomination for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nIt further alleges that on 26 February 2011 AJPL approved the transfer of unsecured loan of  from the All India Congress Committee at zero interest. Swamy argued that it is illegal for any political party to lend the loan as per violation of Section 269T of Income Tax Act 1961. on 2 November, the party responded that the loan was given only for reviving National Herald newspaper with no commercial interest. Swamy decided to approach the Supreme Court for de-recognising the Congress party, while the Election Commission ordered the probe on 17 November 2012.\n\nThe hearing of the case had been taken up thereafter on different occasions with the court observing prima facie evidence against all the accused. on 1 August 2014 the Enforcement Directorate initiated probe to find any money laundering in the case while on the same day Swamy was served notice by the High Court. on 28 August the metropolitan court fixed 9 December for the next hearing of the case, while on 12 January 2015 the judge of the Delhi High Court recused himself from hearing the case stating that schedule of cases has been changed and directed that the petitions be directed before an appropriate bench. on 27 January 2015, the Supreme Court asked Swamy to make out a case for the speedy trial in the Delhi High Court since the petition cannot be heard directly.\n\nOn 18 September 2015 it was reported that the Enforcement Directorate had reopened the investigation. Following it, on 19 December 2015 Patiala House Court granted unconditional bail immediately on the hearing to all the five accused but one. on 12 July 2016 the Delhi High Court set aside the trial court order of 11 January and 11 March based on plea by Swamy to examine balance sheets of Congress party, AJL and Young Indian from 2010 to 2013, and fixed the date of next hearing on 20 August. Currently, the case proceedings are on-going in Delhi High Court.\n\nTemple cases\n\nNataraja temple case\n\nSwamy had filed a petition in the Supreme Court with priests of the Dikshitar sect challenging the decision of the Madras High Court on transferring the administration of the Nataraja temple to the then Tamil Nadu government in 2009.\n\nSwamy on referring to the provisions of Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, contended that Podu Dikshitars have right to administer the temple and argued on handing over the administration on mismanagement grounds of temple's wealth is violation under Article 26 of the Constitution of India. on 6 January 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that the administration is to be handed over back to the priests of the temple from the state government.\n\nState control of Hindu temples\nSubramanian Swamy filed a petition to remove  Kerala State government's control over Hindu temples by abolishing Devaswom. in 2018, the Supreme Court agreed to examine the petition moved by him and TG Mohan Das to abolish Devaswom Board. The Supreme Court issued notice to the Kerala government and Devaswom Board of Travanacore and Cochin and sought their response in six weeks. in 2019, the Kerala government opposed Subramanian Swamy's plea.\n\nAyodhya temple case\n\nOn 22 February 2016, Swamy filed a petition in the Supreme Court allowing construction of Rama temple at the disputed site where Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992, and expediting the adjudication related to order of the Allahabad High Court on 30 September 2010, petition was accepted on 26 February to be later heard by the court.\n\nUttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019 \nIn February 2020, Subramanian Swamy filed a public interest litigation in Uttarakhand High Court against newly framed law to govern Char Dham and 51 other temples of the state. Swamy in his PIL, requested the court to declare the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019 'unconstitutional' which was passed in the legislative assembly of Uttarakhand in December 2019. But the Uttarakhand High Court upheld the constitutionality of the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act, 2019, dismissing the public interest litigation filed by Subramanian Swamy and Sri 5 Mandir Samiti Gangotri Dham and another. However, the Court read down Section 22 of the Act, which was about the acquisition of land for the Char Dham.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nForeign policy\n\nChina \nSwamy has worked towards normalising relations between China and India. According to Swamy, the re-opening of the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage route was announced at a meeting convened by the People's Republic of China paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in April 1981, in which Swamy was in attendance.\n\nIsrael \nIn various speeches and articles, Swamy has expressed his admiration for, and solidarity with, the State of Israel and has credited its retaliatory capacity for its ability to survive as a nation in a hostile Arab environment. Swamy made pioneering efforts towards India's establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nSri Lanka and LTTE \nSwamy, on several occasions, has voiced support for the state of Sri Lanka in its role during Sri Lanka's protracted civil war with the LTTE, for which he was criticised as \"pro Lanka\" by his political opponents domestically. in an interview given to The Sunday Leader newspaper, Swamy stated that the Indian government should attend the CHOGM meeting held in Colombo despite stiff opposition from Indian politicians in Tamil Nadu concerned for the welfare and human rights of Tamils in Sri Lanka, placing the onus on the LTTE for human rights violations during the Sri Lankan civil war, he had favoured Mahinda Rajapaksa also during Sri Lanka 2015 election.\n\nUnited States \nSwamy is a strong supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, endorsing Trump's presidential candidacy in 2016 and comparing Trump to himself.\n\nAfter the Charlottesville riots in August 2017, he posted a tweet urging Indians residing in the United States to \"stand with Trump at this hour of his being hunted by cockeyed liberals & Left wing loonies on racism\" and praised Trump for \"having showed the hypocrites their place by telling it like it is.\"\n\nFollowing criticism of Pakistan by Trump, Swamy called for closer relations between India and the United States.\n\nDomestic policy\n\nCow \nIn March 2017, he brought a privat member's bill to punish cow slaughter in India with capital punishment.\n\nLGBT rights \nIn 2018, when the Indian Supreme Court decriminalized gay sexual acts, Swamy criticised the ruling, saying \"It could give rise to an increase in the number of HIV cases.\"\n\nKashmir \nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our defining identity. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. for our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\nPakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.\n\nTamil Nadu politics \nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, calling it as the theory forwarded by the British. He has been a staunch opponent of the armed rebel group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.\nHe also urged the Indian government not to support the US led resolution condemning war crimes in the Sri Lankan Civil War, citing it as one-sided and not in the interest of India. Swamy moved the court and got the order restoring quota for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in colleges in the state.\n\nSwamy obtained Supreme Court Stay against the implementation of Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP). He believes that it would hurt the sentiments of people who believe that this shallow land connecting between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka was built by Lord Rama. He strongly opposes the implementation of SSCP citing that implementing this scheme will be a criminal offence under section 295 Indian Penal Code. He wrote letters to Prime Minister of India in June 2009 asking him to stop the project and had informed the Supreme Court on 14 October 2015 that the government may not continue with the Sethusamudram Project.\n\nHindu nationalism \nSwamy has made several statements in the past that reflect on his Hindu nationalist position. He has called for the creation of an \"enlightened secular democracy which redresses all historical wrongs done to Hindus.\" He has claimed that India is the world's most ancient civilization that consists of \"an organic cultural core which is Hindu in character.\" He has also claimed that the Hindu foundation of India is what makes India distinctive in the world.\n\nMuslims \nAfter the 2011 Mumbai bombings, he wrote an controversial editorial wherein, as a response to Islamic terrorism, he called for the removal of 300 mosques built at sites of Hindu temples. and for the disenfranchisement of Muslims unless they \"acknowledge that their ancestors were Hindus\". After the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard voted to have his classes removed for \"demonising\" Muslims, his regular Harvard summer teaching sessions were cancelled because of this article.\n\nIn a 2020 Vice interview, he stated that under the Indian constitution, \"Article 14 guarantees equality of equals\" and that \"there is no such thing as equal rights, they [Muslim immigrants] are not in an equal category.\" He added, \"We know that where the Muslim population is large, there is always trouble.\" He later claimed that this had been misinterpreted in a tweet stating, \"One fake quote is that I had declared Muslims are not equal to Hindus under Art. 14.\"\n\nConspiracy theory \n\nIn September 2020, Swamy said that India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had \"unearthed huge evidence\" to prove in court that Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death was \"murder by conspiracy.\" Swamy also said there had been \"systematic destruction\" of evidence in the case. Two weeks before, Swamy had said the Mumbai Police were \"complicit\" in the murder, that Dubai was \"involved,\" and that \"the Bollywood Cartel remains to be identified and made as 'accessory before the murder'.\" in October 2020, after a medical board from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) ruled out murder, stating that the actor died by suicide, a team of scientists associated with Microsoft Research, India released an independent report, \"Anatomy of a Rumour: Social media and the suicide of Sushant Singh Rajput.\" They wrote, \"Perhaps the most interesting case is that of sitting parliamentarian Subramanian Swamy, once a central player in the policy circles, now wilfully [sic] mongering deceit, and also the most popular Twitter handle in wordclouds [sic] of trolls.\" In December 2020, after more than four months of investigation, the CBI sent Swamy a 3-page letter stating it was looking into all aspects of the case \"in a thorough and professional manner using latest scientific techniques,\" and that \"no aspect has been ruled out,\" but making no mention of Swamy's conspiracy theories.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nBooks, research papers and journals\nSwamy is the author of several books, research papers and journals. a complete list of papers, books and journals authored by him is given below. He has also co-authored with Paul Samuelson, a paper on the Theory of Index Numbers (American Economic Review, 1974) and another in the Royal Economic Society's Economic Journal (1984).\n\nBooks\n Hindutva and National Renaissance (Publisher: Har Anand Publication; )\n Virat Hindu Identity - Concept and its Power (Publisher: Har Anand Publication; )\n Economic Growth in China and India, 1952–70 (Publisher: University of Chicago Press; )\n Indian economic planning: an alternative approach (Publisher: Barnes & Noble \/ Vikas publications; )\n Building a New India: an Agenda for National Renaissance (Publisher: UBS PUBLISHERS' AND DISTRIBUTORS LTD; )\n India's Labour Standards and the WTO Framework (Publisher: Konark Publishers; )\n India's economic performance and reforms: a perspective for the new millennium (Publisher: Konark Publishers; )\n Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi: Unanswered Questions and Unasked Queries (Publisher: Konark Publishers; )\n India's China perspective (Publisher: Konark Publishers; )\n Financial Architecture and Economic Development in China and India (Publisher: Konark Publishers; )\n Trade and Industry in Japan: a Guide to Indian Entrepreneurs and Businessmen (Publisher: Prentice-Hall of India; )\n Sri Lanka in Crisis: India's Options (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n Kailas and Manasarovar after 22 years in Shiva's domain (Publisher: Allied Publishers)\n Hindus Under Siege (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n Rama Setu: Symbol of National Unity (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n Terrorism in India: a Strategy of Deterrence for India's National Security (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n Corruption and Corporate Governance in India: Satyam, Spectrum & Sundaram (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n 2G Spectrum Scam (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n Electronic Voting Machines: Unconstitutional and Tamperable (Publisher: Vision Books; )\n \n The Ideology of India’s Modern Right (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n RESET: Regaining India’s Economic Legacy (Publisher: Rupa Publications; ) RESET was top selling new eBook of 2019.\nHimalayan Challenge: India, China and the Quest for Peace (Publisher: Rupa Publications India; )\nThe Hindu Manifesto for India's Democracy (Publisher: Har Anand Publications; )\n\nArticles\n  \"Can India make it?

        "text":"Gino Pollini (19 January 1903 in Rovereto – 25 January 1991 in Milan) was an Italian architect.\n\nLife \nGino Pollini was born in Rovereto on January 19, 1903, to Luigi Pollini, a shopkeeper, and Teresa Miori Pollini. At the time of Pollini's birth, Rovereto was part of Austria. After WWI, the city became part of the north eastern region of Trentino–Alto Adige in Italy. In 1921, he began studies at the Politecnico di Milano, taking courses off and on, and received his architecture degree in 1927. He married Renata Melotti, sister of sculptor Fausto Melotti and cousin of theorist Carlo Belli, in February 1931. They had a child Maurizio in 1942.\n\nCareer\nIn 1926 Pollini joined Gruppo 7 (Sebastiano Larco, Guido Frette, Carlo Enrico Rava,  Luigi Figini, Giuseppe Terragni, Ubaldo Castagnoli), and from 1929 he worked in collaboration with Luigi Figini. Figini & Pollini had a long association with the Olivetti company from 1934 through 1957, designing many of their headquarters buildings at Ivrea. In 1927, Pollini was invited by the architect Alberto Sartoris to travel to Stuttgart with Gruppo 7 members Rava and Libera to work on clarifying a new language for modernist architecture. He also taught architecture in Milan and Palermo.\n\nReferences \n\n1903 births\n1991 deaths\nPeople from Rovereto\nModernist architects from Italy\nCongrès International d'Architecture Moderne members\n20th-century Italian architects",

        "text":"The driverless cars has been an idea that has been around for many years. The thought of not having to waste energy in driving and to make the experience more relaxing for the individual. It will also display the amount of intellegence and engineering it would take in order to construct such a car. However, there will be many different people who will wish to insult and bring down the idea of the driverless cars. Not only that, but there will people in the world who would wish to turn the positive idea into a negative one. It will also start to corrupt our natural human abilities. What I mean by that is humans will start to become more and more relient on having everything completed for them with minimal effort envolved. Eventually, we will start to become lazier and lazier as advancements in technology increases. One thing to note, I am not entirely against automation or self-seficient machinery. However, how could we say that we are hard working individuals when a robot will be doing the work for us? Could we truely call ourselves hard working when all we would have to do is push a button? this will be a problem in the future  there won't be any laws inplace of the driverless cars.  Numerous states have already opposed the idea and plan to keep it that way until the cars are proven reliable. In paragraph 9, it also discusses who will be counted liable for an accident. \"...if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?\"(Waiting)  The point that I am trying to make is that we are expanding too rapidly. The ideas are good and can be benificial in the future, but lets take our time and make shure that these driverless cars can actually drive themselves. It is difficult to say when these will be done, but when they are, I hope that it will be avalible for everyone",

        "text":"So at a super basic\/plain physics level: you are made of matter and when you \"blob\" a whole bunch of atoms next to each other they collide and create heat due to friction. On a slightly larger scale, every cell that's moving is creating friction with the things around it. Every sound your body makes is energy turning into heat (through digestion, heart beat, etc). \n\nFrom the biochemical view (the lionshare of heat comes from this): you put in food, it gets broken down and turned into various compounds your body needs; you then absorb some of the nutrients ( from the compounds) into your blood where your cells then use them for food. They burn some of those nutrients so your cells have enough energy for mitosis which is a process that also releases heat ( and that's why we eat). \n\nMitosis is a cell making cells. We need that cuz old cells die and we need new cells to replace them. Old cells are expelled along with you non-nutrients aka waste. There's also a bunch of different bacteria that are actually good for you in your body and they might give off a really small amount of heat, but they're there because you're the right temp for them to thrive.\n\nUhhh, hope that was helpful even though it wasn't super specific. Another way people produce heat is by sitting in a court room whilst knowing that the glove fits.\n\nEdit: clarification.",

        "text":"Oscar James Dunn (1822 – November 22, 1871) served as a Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana during the era of Reconstruction and was the first African American to act as governor of a U.S. state. \n\nIn 1868, Dunn became the first elected black lieutenant governor of a U.S. state. He ran on the ticket headed by Henry Clay Warmoth, formerly of Illinois. In 1871, he became the first black acting governor of a U.S. state after Governor Warmoth injured his foot and left Louisiana to recuperate on two occasions. Article 53 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1868 required the lieutenant governor to serve as acting governor \"in case of impeachment of the Governor, his removal from office, death . . . resignation or absence from the state.\" Dunn served as acting governor of Louisiana for a total of 39 days. Dunn died in office, and the state legislature elected state Senator P. B. S. Pinchback, another black Republican, to replace him as lieutenant governor. A year later, Pinchback became acting governor for his own 34-day interim stint.\n\nEarly life \n\nIn approximately 1822, Dunn was born into slavery in New Orleans. His mother Maria Dunn was enslaved under the law of the time. He received her status and was also enslaved. His father, James Dunn, had been freed in 1819 by his owner. James Dunn was born into slavery in Petersburg, Virginia and had been transported to the Deep South during the forced migration of more than one million African Americans from the Upper South. He was bought by James H. Caldwell of New Orleans, who founded the St. Charles Theatre and New Orleans Gas Light Company. Dunn worked for Caldwell as a skilled carpenter for decades, including after his emancipation by Caldwell in 1819.\n\nAfter being emancipated, Dunn married Maria, then enslaved, and they had two children, Oscar and Jane. Slave marriages were not recognized under the law. By 1832, Dunn had earned enough money as a carpenter to purchase the freedom of his wife and both children. Their status as free blacks was gained decades before the American Civil War. As English speakers, they were not, however, part of the culture of free people of color in Louisiana, who were primarily of French descent and culture and of the Catholic religion.\n\nJames Dunn continued to work as a carpenter for his former master Caldwell. His wife, Maria Dunn, ran a boarding house for actors and actresses who were in the city to perform at the Caldwell theatres. Together, they were able to pay for education for their children. Having studied music, Dunn became both an accomplished musician and an instructor of the violin.\n\nOscar Dunn was apprenticed as a young man to a plastering and painting contractor, A. G. Wilson. Wilson verified Dunn's free status in the Mayor's Register of Free People of Color 1840–1864. On November 23, 1841, the contractor reported Dunn as a runaway in a newspaper ad in the New Orleans Times-Picayune. However, Dunn must have returned to work because he progressed in the world.\n\nDunn was an English-speaking free black in a city in which the racial caste system was the underpinning of daily life. Ethnic French, including many free people of color, believed their culture was more subtle and flexible than that brought by the English-speaking residents, who came to the city in the early-to-mid-19th century after the Louisiana Purchase and began to dominate it in number. Free people of color had been established as a separate class of merchants, artisans and property owners, many of whom had educations. However, American migrants from the South dismissed their special status, classifying society in binary terms, as black or white, despite a long history of interracial relations in their own history.\n\nFreemasonry\nDunn joined Prince Hall Richmond Lodge #4, one of a number of fraternal organizations that expanded to New Orleans, out of the Prince Hall Ohio Lodge during the 19th century. In the latter half of the 1850s, he rose to Master and Grand Master of the Eureka Grand Lodge which became the Louisiana Grand Lodge [Prince Hall\/York Rite]. Author and historian, Joseph A. Walkes Jr., a Prince Hall Freemason, credits Dunn with outstanding conduct of Masonic affairs in Louisiana. As a Freemason, Dunn developed his leadership skills, and he established a wide network and power base in the black community that was essential for his later political career.\n\nMarriage and family\nIn December 1866, Dunn married Ellen Boyd Marchand, a widow born free in Ohio. She was the daughter of Henry Boyd and his wife of Ohio. He adopted her three children, Fannie (9), Charles (7) and Emma (5). The couple did not have children together. In 1870, the Dunn family residence was on Canal Street, one block west of South Claiborne Avenue and within walking distance of Straight University and the St. James A.M.E. Church complex, where they were members.\n\nReconstruction era and politics\n\nDunn worked to achieve equality for the millions of blacks freed by passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified after the American Civil War. He actively promoted and supported the Universal Suffrage Movement, advocated land ownership for all blacks, taxpayer-funded education of all black children, and equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. He joined the Republican Party, many of whose members supported suffrage for blacks.\n\nDunn opened an employment agency that assisted in finding jobs for the freedmen. He was appointed as Secretary of the Advisory Committee of the Freedmen's Savings and Trust Company of New Orleans, established by the Freedmen's Bureau. As the city and region struggled to convert to a free labor system, Dunn worked to ensure that recently freed slaves were treated fairly by former planters, who insisted on hiring by year-long contracts. In 1866, he organized the People's Bakery, an enterprise owned and operated by the Louisiana Association of Workingmen.\n\nElected to the New Orleans city council in 1867, Dunn was named chairman of a committee to review Article 5 of the City Charter. He proposed that \"all children between the ages of 6–18 be eligible to attend public schools and that the Board of Aldermen shall provide for the education of all children ... without distinction to color.\" In the state Constitutional Convention of 1867–1868, the resolution was enacted into Louisiana law and laid the foundation for the public education system, established for the first time in the state by the biracial legislature.\n\nDunn was very active in local, state and federal politics, with connections to U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and U.S. Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts. Long before President Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington, President Ulysses S. Grant met him at the White House on April 2, 1869.\n\nRunning for lieutenant governor, he beat a white candidate for the nomination, W. Jasper Blackburn, the former mayor of Minden in Webster Parish, by a vote of fifty-four to twenty-seven. The Warmoth-Dunn Republican ticket was elected, 64,941 to 38,046. That was considered the rise of the Radical Republican influence in state politics. Dunn was inaugurated lieutenant governor on June 13, 1868. He was also the President pro tempore of the Louisiana State Senate. He was a member of the Printing Committee of the legislature, which controlled a million-dollar budget. He also served as President of the Metropolitan Police, which had an annual budget of nearly one million dollars. It struggled to maintain peace in a volatile political atmosphere, especially after the New Orleans Riot of 1866. In 1870, Dunn served on the board of trustees and Examining Committee for Straight University, a historically black college founded in the city.\n\nThe Republicans developed severe internal conflicts. Although elected with Warmoth, as the governor worked toward Fusionist goals, Dunn became allied with the Custom House faction, which was led by Stephen B. Packard and tied in with federal patronage jobs. They had differences with the Warmoth-Pinchback faction, and challenged it for leadership of the party. Warmoth had been criticized for appointing white Democrats to state positions, encouraging alliances with Democrats, and his failure to advance civil rights for blacks. William Pitt Kellogg, whom Warmoth had helped gain election as U.S. Senator in 1868, also allied with Packard and was later elected as governor of the state.\n\nBecause of Dunn's wide connections and influence in the city, his defection to the Custom House faction meant that he would take many Republican ward clubs with him in switching allegiance, especially those made up of African Americans rather than Afro-Creoles (the mixed-race elite that had been established as free before the war). For the Radical Republicans, the city was always more important to their political power than were the rural parishes.\n\nDunn made numerous political enemies during this period. According to The New York Times, Dunn \"had difficulties with Harry Lott\", a Rapides Parish member of the Louisiana House of Representatives (1868–1870, 1870–1872). He also had differences with his eventual successor as lieutenant governor, State Senator P.B.S. Pinchback over policy, leadership, and direction.\n\nDeath\nOn November 22, 1871, Dunn died at home at age 49 after a brief and sudden illness. He had been campaigning for the upcoming state and presidential elections. There was speculation that he was poisoned by political enemies, but no evidence was found. According to Nick Weldon at the Historic New Orleans Collection, Dunn's symptoms were consistent with arsenic poisoning: vomiting and shivering. Only four out of the seven doctors who examined Dunn signed off on the official cause of death, suspecting murder. No confirmation was made because Dunn's family had refused an autopsy.\n\nThe Dunn funeral was reported as one of the largest in New Orleans. As many as 50,000 people lined Canal Street for the procession, and newspapers across the nation reported the event. State officials, Masonic lodges and civic and social organizations participated in the procession from the St. James A.M.E. church to his grave site. He was interred in the Cassanave family mausoleum at St. Louis Cemetery No. 2.\n\nHonors\nW.E.B. Du Bois, leading civil rights activist, later called Dunn \"an unselfish, incorruptible leader.\"\n\nThe New Orleans Times-Picayune published a poem the day after Dunn's death in his honor, entitled The Death Struggle:\n\nSurvivors\nAfter his death, his widow, Ellen, was appointed by the mayor of New Orleans to the position of municipal archives director. Several years later, on November 23, 1875, she married J. Henri Burch. A former state senator from East Baton Rouge Parish, Burch had been an ally of her late husband's, as part of the Custom House faction. The Burch family resided in New Orleans and continued there after the withdrawal of federal troops and the end of Reconstruction, in 1877.\n\nSee also\n List of African-American firsts\n List of minority governors and lieutenant governors in the United States\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Perkins, A.E. \"Oscar James Dunn.\" Phylon 4.2 (1943): 102–121.\n Perkins, A.

        "text":" Constipation usually occurs because there is an insufficient amount of water in your stool, making it hard and difficult to pass. This happens when the peristalsis (muscle contractions)of the intestines stops due to the effect of the general anesthesia used during hernia surgery.\n\n\nIncreasing your fluid intake may help to soften the stool and prevent you from straining during a bowel movement.;\n, Fiber-rich food prevents constipation by pulling water from the colon, which makes the stool softer and easier to pass.\n\n\nMake sure you have a daily fiber intake of at least 21 gramsby eating foods like: raspberries, apples, pears, bananas, oranges, figs, strawberries, raisins, popcorn, brown rice, barley, oatmeal, bread, lentils, almonds, pistachios, green peas, broccoli, turnips, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, carrots and potatoes.\nYou can also take Metamucil, a fiber laxative and supplement. Metamucil can be taken after eating or on an empty stomach. Have a glass of water after you drink Metamucil for better absorption.\nMen, 19 years and older can take 38 g\/day. Women, 19 years and older can take 25 g\/day. Pregnant and lactating women should consult with their doctor before taking Metamucil. Pregnant woman are usually prescribed 28 g\/day and lactating women are usually prescribed 29 g\/day.If approved by their doctor, children can also take Metamucil. Children 1-3 years old can take 19 g\/day; children 4-8 years old can take 25 g\/day. Boys 9-13 years old can take 31 g\/day; girls 9-13 years old can take 26 g\/day. Boys 14-18 years old can take 38 g\/day and girls 14-18 years old can take 26 g\/day., You do not want to strain yourself or lift heavy objects, especially the first few weeks after surgery, as this can cause the surgical incisions to tear.\n\n, Light exercise like walking will help to reduce the time it takes for food to move into the large intestine. This will ensure the water absorbed from the stool is limited. Exercises also stimulate the natural contraction of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. If these muscles contract efficiently, the stools will move out much quicker.\n\n\nExercise an hour after a meal as this will force blood flow to increase towards the stomach and the intestines, which will then help your body to properly digest the food.Walk for at least 15-30 minutes a day at a slow pace so you do not disrupt the surgical site.Do not do any strenuous activities like running, jogging, or playing contact sports during the first four weeks after surgery, as these actions can possibly rupture the surgical incision.\nBedridden patients can dangle their feet on the bed and do arm and feet circling for at least 30 to 45 minutes daily to help promote the return of peristalsis (muscle contractions) in the gastrointestinal tract.The early return of peristalsis can help reduce constipation.\n\n, Smoking cigarettes can further reduce the peristaltic movement of the intestines, which are already depressed due to the general anesthesia used during hernia surgery. The nicotine in cigarettes is a potent vasoconstrictor, which means it makes your blood vessels constrict or narrow, thus reducing blood flow to the intestines.\n\n\nIf blood flow is reduced, then digestion and peristalsis or the rhythmic movement of the intestines are also reduced. This causes the digested food to remain in the intestines for a longer period of time. During this time, the colon continues to absorb water from the digested food, which will lead to a firmer or hard stool and constipation.\n\n, Do not self-medicate. Some stool softeners can cause intestinal bleeding, dependency and can alter the normal environment of the gastrointestinal tract if they are used for too long. Consulting with your doctor will help you find the right stool softener to treat your constipation.\n\n\nColace works by increasing the amount of water that the stool absorbs, making is softer and easier to pass.\nThe ideal dosage of Colace is 50 to 500 mg once a day., Do not exceed two tablets a day and do not take Senna for more than a week, unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor.\n\n\nPatients 2-6 years old should take half a tablet (4.3 mg) of Senna orally at bedtime, and not exceed half a tablet a day. Patients 6-12 years old should take one tablet (8.6 mg) orally at bedtime and not exceed one tablet a day. Patients 13-18 years old should take two tablets (17.2 mg) orally at bedtime and should not exceed four tablets a day.\nSenna should only used by pregnant and breastfeeding women if it is prescribed by their doctor.The prescribed adult dose (18 and older) for Bisacodyl is usually 5 to 15 mg (1 to 3 tablets) orally once a day, with or without food. Do not exceed more than 15 mg a day.\nChildren under 18 and pregnant and breastfeeding women are usually not prescribed with this medication unless otherwise prescribed by the doctor.\n\n, Taking laxatives can affect your body’s ability to absorb other drugs such as antacids, mineral oils, castor oils, antibiotics, blood thinners, heart and bone medications, so always check with your doctor to find the right laxative prescription for you., The pressure of straining during a bowel movement can damage or reopen the wound in your hernia, resulting in blood in your stool.\n\n, Prolonged straining may cause swelling in the veins of the anus. This can also tear the anal structure, especially if a large and hard stool is passed.\n\n, These may all be signs of an infection., When stools are not passed, they stay in the intestines and can block the intestinal opening. This leads to an accumulation of more stools in the impacted part of the intestines and can restrict blood flow, thereby killing the tissues in it. If this occurs, the surrounding pain receptors will be activated and you will likely experience unbearable or excruciating pain.\n\n, An inguinal hernia is common in men because the inguinal canal does not close properly, creating a weakened spot that is prone to hernias. Normally, a man’s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth and the canal closes almost completely behind them. An inguinal hernia develops when the intestines push through the inguinal canal.\n\n\nIn men and women, the inguinal canal is found in the groin area. In men, it is the area where the spermatic cord, which holds up the testicles, passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. In women, the inguinal canal contains a ligament that helps to hold the uterus in place.\n\n, This type of hernia causes gastroesophageal reflux, a burning sensation that occurs due to the leakage of a person’s stomach contents back into their esophagus.\n\n\nA hiatal hernia is most common in people over 50 years old.\nCongenital birth defects may cause a child to develop a hiatal hernia.\n\n, Babies under six months old develop an umbilical hernia if their intestines protrude through the abdominal wall near the belly button. If you notice a bulge or swelling near your child’s belly button when he cries, he may have an umbilical hernia.\n\n\nUmbilical hernias usually go away on their own, once the child reaches one year old.\nIf the hernia is still present after the child turns one, surgery will be required to correct the hernia.\n\n, An incisional hernia occurs when the intestines push through an incision scar or weakened tissue after abdominal surgery.\n\n, This type of surgery causes less damage to the surrounding tissue and requires a shorter recovery period. However, there is a risk of hernia recurrence.\n\n\nThis procedure uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia using small incisions. The hernia is repaired by sewing the hole to close the abdominal wall. A surgical mesh is also used to patch the hole.\n\n, This type of surgery is done for hernias where a portion of the intestines has moved down into the scrotum. A part of the scrotum or groin may be incised to retrieve and reposition the intestine. Then, it is closed using stitches.\n\n\nOpen surgery requires a longer recovery process. But, the patient can resume his normal daily activities six weeks after surgery.\n\n, Hernia surgery is usually performed as an outpatient procedure. The surgeon repositions the herniated tissue and, if strangulation has occurred, removes the oxygen-starved part of the organ. The damaged muscle wall will frequently be repaired with synthetic mesh or tissue.\n\n",

        "text":"  We present the thermoelectric (TE) properties of LaCoO$_{3}$ compound in the\ntemperature range 300-600 K. The experimental value of Seebeck coefficient\n($\\alpha$) at 300 K is found to be $\\sim$635 $\\mu$V\/K. The value of $\\alpha$\ndecreases continuously with increase in temperature and reaches to $\\sim$46\n$\\mu$V\/K at $\\sim$600 K. The electronic and TE properties of the compound have\nalso been investigated by combining the \\textit{ab-initio} electronic\nstructures and Boltzmann transport calculations. LSDA plus Hubbard U (U= 2.75\neV) calculation on low spin configuration of the compound gives an energy gap\nof $\\sim$0.5 eV, which is close to the experimentally reported energy gap. The\neffective mass of holes (\\textit{m$^{*}_h$}) at $\\Gamma$ point is nearly two\ntimes larger than the value of effective mass of electrons (\\textit{m$^{*}_e$})\nat FB point along the L and T directions, whereas the \\textit{m$^{*}_e$} at FB\npoint along the $\\Gamma$ direction is nearly eight times larger than the value\nof \\textit{m$^{*}_h$} at $\\Gamma$ point along the FB direction. The large\neffective mass at FB point along the $\\Gamma$ direction suggests that the TE\nproperty of this compound is mainly decided by the effective mass of the charge\ncarriers in this direction. The calculated temperature dependent values of\n$\\alpha$ are in fairly good agreement with experimental data in the temperature\nrange 300-360 K, and above this temperature slight deviation is observed. The\nvalue of power factor (PF) for \\textit{n}-type is $\\sim$1.3 times larger the\nvalue of \\textit{p}-type doped compound at 1100 K. The value of\n\\textit{figure-of-merit} (\\textit{ZT}) for \\textit{n}-type doped compound is\nobtained $\\sim$0.35 in the temperature range 600-1100 K, which suggests that\nwith appropriate \\textit{n}-type doping this compound can be used as a good TE\nmaterial in the high temperature region.\n",

(things like your intestines, heart, etc).  This system is controlled by nervous signals that you don't conciously control.\n\n**The cool thing is that sometimes these systems overlap.** \n\nSay you're out walking.  A big dog, with large fangs and drool, jumps out and starts to bark at you!  While your conscious mind perceives this threat, your autonomic system sends a signal to your body to enter *\"fight or flight,\"* increasing your heart rate, decreasing blood flow to nonessential organs (like the guts) and increasing flow to the skeletal muscle and brain.\n\n**Second,** other organs aren't really \"on\" and \"off.\"  This is things like the liver and kidney.  There is little to no real nervous innervation controlling their actions directly.  They are always on, and just depend on how much they are doing at one time.  They are mostly controlled by blood flow (which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system) or by hormones and steroids that your body produces (Through the endocrine system, which originates in the BRAIN!).  These organs play a big role in the balance of your body.  In fact if they ever turn off (ie LIVER FAILURE) you pretty much die without a replacement.\n\n\n\n\nThe old saying that we only use 10% of our brain is just not true, however you could say we only use some portion of it knowingly.  The rest is working around the clock, without the conscious involved.\n\n**Links for more info**\n\n* _URL_2_\n\n* _URL_1_\n\n* _URL_0_\n\n**TL\/DR:**\nYour body is controlled by your Nervous and Endocrine systems originating in the brain.  \nThey nervous system is broken into the somatic and autonomic systems.  \nYour \"will\" only has direct control over the somatic, which controls muscles, but not over the autonomic system or the endocrine system, which control the rest.

        "text":" Cannabutter is butter that has been infused with THC from marijuana leaves. It is essential for making marijuana cookies. Making cannabutter is easy, but it is also time consuming and you need a decent amount of marijuana to make it. You will need:2 sticks of unsalted butter\n1\/2 ounce of marijuana (ground and with seeds\/stems removed)\n1 cup of water;\n, The double boiler will melt the butter and allow the marijuana to steep without using too much heat. If you have a double boiler, then you can use it. If not, then you can just set one up on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set up a double boiler, place a large stock pot on your stove and fill it about 1\/3 of the way full with water. Then, place a medium sized bowl over the stockpot. The bowl should be large enough to overlap the edges of the stock pot, but small enough so that the bottom of the bowl will be in or near the water.\nHeating cannabis is necessary to extract the THC and reap the psychoactive effects of the herb.You cannot digest the THC in raw marijuana, so eating raw marijuana would have no effect., Place your two sticks of butter into the bowl of the double boiler and turn the heat on low to medium. The water will heat up and the steam will cause the butter to melt slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the heat low. Do not allow the butter to come to a boil.\nThe THC in cannabis is fat soluble, not water soluble. This means that it is necessary to heat the cannabis in butter or oil to capture the THC for use in baking.If you do not eat dairy and do not want to use butter, then you could use some non-dairy margarine or coconut oil instead.\n\n, While the butter is melting, you can prepare the marijuana. Place a piece of cheese cloth on a clean surface and fold it in half twice. This will help to ensure that no marijuana escapes the cheese cloth. The place your marijuana on the center of the cheese cloth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFold over the shorter edges of the cheese cloth first. Then fold over one of the long edges and roll the marijuana towards the other edge, as if you are rolling a burrito.\nUse the cooking twine to tie up the burrito. Make sure that you wrap the string around the burrito evenly and secure it well or it might fall apart.\n\n, Put your marijuana tea bag into the melted butter. You may need to bend it slightly to make it fit into the bowl. You can also use a metal spoon to push it down into the butter a little further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Adding water will help to cover all of the marijuana with liquid and it will also help the marijuana to release its THC. Pour one cup of hot water into the bowl with the butter and marijuana tea bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that the THC in marijuana is fat soluble, not water soluble. That means that water alone will not extract much of the THC from your marijuana.The water will just help to heat the marijuana so that the THC can be absorbed by the fat in the butter.\n\n, Next, cover the bowl with a heat proof lid and let the marijuana steep in the butter and water for four to six hours. Keep in mind that the longer you steep the marijuana in the butter, the more potent the cannabutter will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want the cannabutter to have too much THC in it, then you might want to stop steeping it at around three to four hours. However, if you want it to be strong, then let it steep for a full six hours.\n\n, When the marijuana is done steeping, the butter will have a green tinge to it.Remove the bowl from the double boiler using oven mitts to protect your hands from the heat. Then, remove the marijuana teabag from the butter with a slotted metal spoon and set it aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also want to use a second metal spoon to press the marijuana tea bag and squeeze out any excess liquid from the teabag back into the bowl.\n\n, You can leave the marijuana butter in the bowl to cool or transfer it to a different container if you prefer. Let the bowl and marijuana butter cool down to room temperature slowly and then transfer the bowl to the refrigerator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can leave the butter in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.If you transfer the liquid to a foil pan, then you can easily drain away the water after it cools.\n\n, After the butter has cooled down to room temperature, it will be back in a solid form. The butter will also have risen to the top of the bowl and the water you added will be at the bottom of the bowl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPour out the water and keep the butter. You can use a strainer or just punch a hole in the bottom of your foil pan if you transferred the butter.\nThe butter is now ready to use to make chocolate chip cookies or as a one to one substitute for regular butter in your favorite cookie recipe. For example, if the recipe calls for ½ cup of butter, then replace the butter with ½ cup of cannabutter.\n\n, Measure out your 1 and 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Measure out ½ cup of cannabutter, 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the cannabutter is at room temperature before you start mixing the cannabutter and sugar.\n\n, Next, add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and the egg to the cannabutter and sugar mixture. Use the hand mixer to combine all of the ingredients together until they create a uniform mixture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Measure out 1 and 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, To complete the dough, you will need to sift in the dry ingredients that you prepared. Add the flour, salt, and baking soda to the wet ingredients. As you add the dry ingredients, use a spatula or spoon to mix the dry and wet ingredients together until a dough forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper or spray it with some non-stick cooking spray. Space out the dough balls evenly on the cookie sheet.For large cookies, scoop ¼ cup of dough at a time onto the cookie sheet.\nIf you want smaller cookies, then try adding one tablespoon at a time onto the cookie sheet.\n\n, For small cookies, bake your cookies at 375 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.If you want your cookies to be chewier, then cook them for around 10 minutes. If you want them to be crunchier, then cook them for around 12 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor larger cookies, bake the cookies at 325 degrees for 18 to 25 minutes. Closer to 18 minutes will result in a chewier cookies, while closer to 25 minutes will result in a crunchier cookie.\n\n",

You need to learn the basic elements of fishing such as how to tie a lure and bait a hook. You can only do this through practice.;\n, Fishing clubs are a great way to meet others close to your skill level and above. The individuals in the clubs will have tips, techniques and will turn you on toward the bite. They often hold their own small tournaments.\n\n, Different types of fish require different types of fishing techniques. It is difficult to be successful at them all without mastering a few.\n\n\nCertain species like certain baits. Don't fall into the trap of using catfish baits on bass, for example. There are thousands of manufacturers that make a wide variety of bass baits. Even the same bait in a slightly different color pattern can make all the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany fishermen make the mistake of not understanding the importance of fishing line selection. Don't skimp on quality for a cheaper price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Almost every area of the country, no matter how large or small, has a body of water that is inhabited by one or a few predominant species. Master the art of fishing for these species. Sooner or later, there will be a small tournament for these that are your specialty.\n\n\nYou will need some small tournament wins in order to qualify for the top dollar tournaments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will learn from more experienced tournament contestants and this knowledge will eventually give you an edge in your future career endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Most professional fishing tournaments use a pro-am type of field. There are normally two men to a single boat. The boat owner is the professional and is fishing for the big bucks. The co-angler is the amateur, or the inexperienced professional, that is fishing for the smaller, alternate purse. Many times, the alternate purse includes a boat and possibly a truck to pull it.\n\n, You will need to get some endorsements in order to make your career as a professional fisherman lucrative. Tournament wins are nice, but you can easily spend as much on the quality equipment you need as you will win in any given tournament. Once you are endorsed, your name becomes viral and that is the true sign of a professional fisherman.\n\n\nThe fastest way to get endorsements is to market yourself to local bait and tackle stores in your area. These will not likely amount to much cash in hand, but if you adorn yourself and your boat with advertising stickers, these places might give you free equipment, if not money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will have to win many local tournaments, and at least one major, to get the lucrative endorsements from the major brands and outlets. The more tournaments you win, the more the local shops will be willing to endorse you as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These existing datasets and methods\ncannot meet the requirements of summarizing numerous academic papers into a\nstructured summary. To deal with the scarcity of available data, we propose\nBigSurvey, the first large-scale dataset for generating comprehensive summaries\nof numerous academic papers on each topic. We collect target summaries from\nmore than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference\npapers' abstracts as input documents. To organize the diverse content from\ndozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of processing long text\nsequences, we propose a summarization method named category-based alignment and\nsparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method\noutperforms various advanced summarization methods.\n",

        "text":" One of the most important aspects of lab safety is preventing your body from being exposed to contaminants. The first step in wearing proper protective equipment (PPE) is coming to lab prepared with long pants and closed-toe shoes. Shoes with a hard top are preferred in case you drop something on your feet.Once you get to lab, you will put on the rest of the PPE that will cover any other exposed parts of your body.\nTuck in loose, baggy clothing and roll up long sleeves.;\n, The lab coat is essential for protecting you and your clothes from spills and other chemicals. It can quickly be removed in case of a spill. The lab coat needs to fit you well in order to be effective. Wear your lab coat whenever you are doing anything in the lab.\n\n\nIf the sleeves are too long they can get in the way and be cumbersome while working.\n\n, Goggles do not have to be worn at all times, but they must be worn when handling chemicals or working with anything with a splash or explosion hazard.\n\n\nGoggles must wrap around the sides of your face to protect the eyes from all sides.\n\n, There are a number of different types of gloves that you may need to wear depending on what you are working with. For basic safety and protection from harmful chemicals, disposable latex or nitrile gloves will be worn. This is most likely what you will be using in your lab at school.\n\n\nIf you are working with extremely hot or extremely cold substances, you will need to wear special gloves that are temperature appropriate.\nWhen working with anything that conducts electricity and could be a shock hazard, you need to wear rubber gloves.\n\n",

        "text":" If the cat is new to the home, the cat should remain in a safe space in your house at all times, like a spare bedroom. Keep everything the cat needs in that space: food, water, and litter. Unless it chooses to leave that space, let the cat get comfortable with a small area before allowing it to roam.\n\n\nMake sure your cat has easy access to litter. Ideally, litter-boxes should be in multiple locations in the house. The fewer litter-boxes and fewer the locations, the higher the chance of an issue.\nIf the dog is new to the home, begin crate training. Do not keep the dog outside. Being new to a home is stressful for a dog just as it is for a cat to have a new doggie roommate. Dogs are highly social and should be kept inside, especially during this critical bonding time. Just like cats need to learn positive associations with the new dog, the dog needs to learn positive associations (and positive habits!) in its new home. Leaving it outside is asking to have a wound up, stressed out dog that develops anxiety (separation anxiety, barrier frustration, you name it) and takes it out by jumping the fence or digging up the yard.\nMake sure the cat has a safe place to escape, which the dog cannot access. Cats love tall perches.;\n, Both cats and dogs have a developed sense of smell, and it's much safer to introduce both animals to the scent of the other for a while, before letting them be in the room together. This is a critical step in letting the animals get familiar with each other.Take a blanket, sleeping pad, or chew toy that your dog has used, and put it in the cat's area. Take the cat's blanket and let the dog spend some time with it.\n\n, Be wary of the term \"aggressive.\" Most people think of this as growling, biting, etc. However in a dog\/cat predator\/prey interaction, what you really want to avoid is arousal, the stages before aggression. This means you want to avoid having the dog get over excited or over interested. Obsessing over the cat, chasing the cat, stalking the cat, herding the cat, overenthusiastic play with the cat... Those behaviors can look totally adorable and like the dog just loves the cat but that is when you want to call your dog away from the cat and reward with treats. You want to encourage the dog to feel indifferent about the cat, not \"unaggressive.\"\n\n, Walk your dog by your cat's safe room regularly and associate the smell from the blanket with the cat's area. Slowly build up to a more substantial interaction. First with the door closed, then with a baby gate or other room divider, and keep the dog on leash while you do it.\n\n\nMerely walking by with your dog will be intense for your cat. Calm the dog down as quickly as possible, if it reacts excitedly or aggressively. Make the dog sit and reward it for good behavior.\nDon't put your cat in a crate and allow your dog to sniff around it. Your cat will feel trapped and will associate your dog with fear., After the pets can reliably see one another without reacting excitedly or aggressively, let them be together in the same room. The dog should be on leash and if it is not showing interest in the cat then let it drag its leash. This might be nerve-wracking, but try to be quiet and calm. Your attitude will affect the animals.Try not to let the dog to rush up to the cat and smell. Instead, call your dog away from the cat and reward with treats and praise. If your dog will not stop staring at your cat and pulling away, increase your distance until you can distract your dog.\nSimilarly, reward your cat when the dog is near. This is easier with two people. Try to have someone to \"guard\" the cat while someone else \"guards\" the dog.\n\n, Even animals that are getting along well can start to antagonize each other. Before it gets to that, end the interaction by moving the animals to other rooms, and treating both of them.\n\n\nIf your animals are content to be in the same room and ignore each other, you can stop separating them.\n\n, Socializing a dog and cat should take several weeks, and may take longer. Keep the pets moving forward and get them familiar with each other. Each stage should take a few days, at least. Pay attention to your pets and read their body language to see how they react and go according to their cues., Whenever the cat sees, smells, hears, or otherwise interacts with the dog, both animals should be rewarded with treats, pets, toys, or whatever is pleasing to that cat. You want to make sure the cat is comfortable and never forced into meeting or getting near the dog.\n\n\nDo not scream and yell at your dog for being excited. This will only make it worse. Remain calm and increase your distance. As soon as your dog starts to calm down and disengages with the cat (try having her do a familiar trick like \"sit\" or \"watch\") give her a reward like a treat.\nDon't scold your cat for swatting at your dog. This is a normal way for a cat to establish boundaries with your dog and will typically do no damage to your dog. It is a warning swat.\n\n, Cats like to be high up, where they can feel safe and survey their surroundings. It's a good idea to provide your cats a cat tree or otherwise clear off the top of a bookshelf or other area and make it easily accessible to the cat. This can be a great way to let your pets be in the room together, so both of them can feel safe.\n\n, Your goal is to have your cat associate your dog's presence with positive rewards and to have your dog associate disengaging with your cat with positive rewards.If your cat is forced to be around your dog you may create a negative association that is irreversible or may take years to correct.\n\n\nThose commercials where the cats and the dogs snuggle? Those kinds of relationships are super-rare between pets, even though they're insanely cute. The best you can hope for is that your pets mostly ignore each other, and can tolerate the presence of one another. If you've done that, you've done extremely well.\n\n, If your pets aren't used to each other yet, don't let them have access to each other when you're not there. A dog's prey-drive can be triggered and sadly dogs who were getting along for months with their new kitty friend have been known to kill the cat.\n\n\nEven if your dog is doing a good job of leaving your cat alone when you call, be wary about dropping the leash and for several weeks allow the dog to drag the leash around the house so that you can quickly pull her away if needed.\n\n, By taking away your cat's natural defenses, you will cause them to potentially be more aggressive because they are aware they are missing their number one tool to protect themselves. Also, you increase chances of excessive biting and litterbox issues.\n\n\nYour dog will be fine. Cats are almost never the aggressors. When cats swat at dogs, it's either a sign of play or a warning swat.\n\n, Even if everything is going well, ensure they both have time apart. Spend an equal amount of time with both animals, showing them affection. Use positive reinforcement and keep your animals happy.\n\n",

        "text":"Solingen (; ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located some 25 km east of Düsseldorf along the northern edge of the region called Bergisches Land, south of the Ruhr area, and, with a 2009 population of 161,366, is after Wuppertal the second-largest city in the Bergisches Land. It is a member of the regional authority of the Rhineland.\n\nSolingen is called the \"City of Blades\", since it has long been renowned for the manufacturing of fine swords, knives, scissors and razors made by famous firms such as WKC, DOVO, Wüsthof, Zwilling J. A. Henckels, Böker, Güde, Hubertus, Diefenthal, Puma, Clauberg, Eickhorn, Linder, Carl Schmidt Sohn, Dreiturm, Herder, Martor Safety Knives, and numerous other manufacturers.\n\nIn medieval times, the swordsmiths of Solingen designed the town's coat of arms, which continues to the present. In the latter part of the 17th century, a group of swordsmiths from Solingen broke their guild oaths by taking their sword-making secrets with them to Shotley Bridge, County Durham in England.\n\nGeography\n\nSolingen lies southwest of Wuppertal in the Bergisches Land. The city has an area of , of which roughly 50% is used for agriculture, horticulture, or forestry. The city's border is  long, and the city's dimensions are  east to west and  north to south. The Wupper river, a right tributary of the Rhine, flows through the city for . The city's highest point at 276 metres (906 ft) is in the northern borough of Gräfrath at the Light Tower, previously the water tower, and the lowest point at 53 metres (174 ft) is in the southwest.\n\nNeighbouring cities and communities\nThe following cities and communities share a border with Solingen, starting in the northeast and going clockwise around the city:\nWuppertal (unitary urban district)\nRemscheid (unitary urban district)\nWermelskirchen (within the Rheinisch-Bergischer district)\nLeichlingen (Rheinisch-Bergischer district)\nLangenfeld (within the district of Mettmann)\nHilden (Mettmann)\nHaan (Mettmann)\n\nCity administration\nSolingen currently consists of five boroughs. Each borough has a municipal council of either 13 or 15 representatives (Bezirksvertreter) elected every five years by the borough's population. The municipal councils are responsible for many of the boroughs' important administrative affairs.\n\nThe five city boroughs:\nGräfrath\nWald (Solingen)\n(Solingen-)Mitte\nOhligs\/Aufderhöhe\/Merscheid\nHöhscheid\/Burg\n\nThe individuals boroughs are in part composed of separate quarters or residential areas with their own names, although they often lack precise borders.

Early variations of the name included \"Solengen\", \"Solungen\", and \"Soleggen\", although the modern name seems to have been in use since the late 14th and early 15th centuries.\n\nBlacksmiths' smelters, dating back over 2000 years, have been found around the town, adding to Solingen's fame as a Northern Europe blacksmith centre. Swords from Solingen have turned up in places such as the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the British Isles. Northern Europe prized the quality of Solingen's manufactured weaponry, and they were traded across the European continent. Solingen today remains the knife-centre of Germany.\n\nIt was a tiny village for centuries, but became a fortified town in the 15th century.\n\nThirty Years' War\nAfter being ravaged by the plague with about 1,800 deaths in 1614–1619, Solingen was heavily fought-over during the Thirty Years' War, repeatedly attacked and plundered, and the Burg Castle was destroyed.\n\nModern Age\n\nIn 1929, Ohligs located in the Prussian Rhine Province,  by rail north of Cologne became part of Solingen. Its chief manufactures were cutlery and hardware, and there were iron-foundries and flour mills. Other industries were brewing, dyeing, weaving and brick-making.\n\nIn World War II, the Old Town was completely destroyed by a bombing raid by the RAF in 1944; 1,800 people died and over 1,500 people were injured. As such, there are few pre-war sites in the centre.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1949 Solingen was part of the British occupation zone. Reconstruction of the old town began in 1949. The newly built Protestant church in Fronhof was consecrated in 1954, and the destroyed towers of the Catholic church of St. Clemens were rebuilt in a different style. By the end of the 1970s, the city's population had increased due to numerous new housing developments in all parts of the city. The city's infrastructure continued to grow, with the opening of the theatre and concert hall in 1963 and the construction of the Viehbachtalstraße motorway through the city in the late 1970s. In 1975, the city grew again with the incorporation of the previously independent town of Burg an der Wupper. In 1993, Solingen made international headlines for a right-wing extremist arson attack in which five Turkish girls and women were killed. The attack was followed by demonstrations and riots in the city.\n\nSince the beginning of the new millennium, the Klingenstadt has undergone a massive transformation as a result of urban development projects such as Regionale 2006 and City 2013. For example, the new Korkenzieherstrasse cycle path was created and the demolition of the Turmhotel and the former Karstadt Passage made it possible to build a new shopping centre on Neumarkt in Solingen-Mitte. After the closure of the old central station in Solingen-Mitte, Ohligs station was officially named the new Solingen central station by Deutsche Bahn AG on 10 December 2006.\n\nPopulation\nSolingen's population doubled between the years 1880 and 1890 due to the incorporation of the town of Dorp into Solingen in 1889, at which time the population reached 36,000. The population again received a large boost on August 1, 1929 through the incorporation of Ohligs, Wald, Höhscheid, and Gräfrath into the city limits. This brought the population above the 100,000 mark, which gave Solingen the distinction of being a \"large city\" (Großstadt). The number of inhabitants peaked in 1971 with 177,899 residents, and the 2006 population figure was 163,263.\n\nThe following chart shows the population figures within Solingen's city limits at the respective points in time. The figures are derived from census estimates or numbers provided by statistical offices or city agencies, with the exception of figures preceding 1843, which were gathered using inconsistent recording techniques.\n\n30.9% of the population of Solingen has foreign roots (statistics 2012).\n\nPolitics\n\nMayor\nThe people of Solingen have been able to elect a council and a mayor since 1374, the year the town was granted its charter. The mayor changed annually on 24 June. Solingen has had a mayor since 1896. During the National Socialist era (1933-1945), the mayor was appointed by the NSDAP and not democratically elected by the people of Solingen.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the military government of the British occupation zone appointed a Lord Mayor. From 1946, the Solingen City Council elected an honorary Lord Mayor and a full-time Lord Mayor from among its members. Until 1997, the honorary lord mayors had mainly representative functions, while the full-time lord mayors were the chief administrative officers of the city of Solingen. In 1997, the dual leadership of the city administration was abolished. Since then there has been only one full-time Lord Mayor. He is the chairman of the council, the head of the city administration and the first representative of the city. Since 1999, the Lord Mayor has been directly elected by the electorate in a secret ballot.\n\nThe current Mayor of Solingen is Tim Kurzbach of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:\n\n! colspan=2| Candidate\n! Party\n!

This line has been operated by Abellio Deutschland since 15 Dec. 2013. The Rhein-Wupper-Bahn (RB 48) runs over the Gruiten–Köln-Deutz line to Bonn-Mehlem via Opladen and Cologne. It has been operated by National Express as of 13 Dec. 2015.\n\nTrolleybus\n\nSolingen has a trolleybus network, one of only three in Germany remaining besides Eberswalde and Esslingen am Neckar.\n\nAir transport\nThe nearest airports are Düsseldorf Airport and Cologne Bonn Airport. Both airports can be reached by train from Solingen-Hauptbahnhof (change trains at Köln Messe\/Deutz station for the S-Bahn 13 to Cologne Bonn Airport). Other easily reached airports are Frankfurt Airport (ICE train stop), Dortmund Airport (railway station \"Holzwickede\" on the RE7 trainline) and the low cost Weeze Airport (coaches from Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof).\n\nReligion\n\nChristianity\nSolingen has belonged from its beginnings to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne (Erzbistum Köln), and more specifically to the Archdeaconry of the Probst (provost) of St. Kunibert, the deanery of Deutz. Although the Protestant Reformation gradually made gains in the city, which was under the control of the Counts of Berg, the population by and large remained Roman Catholic for a while. The Catholic community was newly endowed by the local lord in 1658 and in 1701 received a new church building. In 1827 Solingen became the seat of its own deanery within the newly defined Archdiocese of Cologne, to which the city's current parishes still belong.\n\nAs mentioned, the Reformation only gradually gained a foothold in Solingen. A reformed church affiliated with the Bergisch synod was established in 1590, and the city's parish church became reformed in 1649. Lutherans had been present in Solingen since the beginning of the 17th century, and a Lutheran congregation was founded in 1635. In 1672 a formalized religious agreement was reached between the city's religious groups. The Reformation was also introduced in Gräfrath in 1590, where a church council was apparently established in 1629. The Reformed and Lutheran churches were formed into a united church community in 1838 following the general merger of Reformed and Lutheran churches in Prussia in 1817.\n\nThe Protestant parishes originally belonged to the district synod of Lennep, today part of the city Remscheid. A new synod was established in Solingen in 1843, and the city acquired its own superintendent, a form of church administrator. This formed the basis for the present-day Church District of Solingen, a member of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland. With the exception of the free churches, most Protestant churches belong to the Church District of Solingen.\n\nToday approximately 34% of Solingen's population belongs to Protestant churches, and roughly 26% belong to Catholic churches. Other church communities in Solingen include Greek Orthodox, Evangelical Free (including Baptist and Brethren), Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Pentecostal, Salvation Army, and free churches. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses and the New Apostolic Church also have communities in Solingen.\n\nGallery\n\nIslam\nMost of the Turkish immigrants belong to the Muslim faith and they have several mosques\/worship places in Solingen:\n DITIB Solingen Wald\n Mesjid Nur\n Islamische Gemeinde Milli Görüs (IGMG)\n Islamisches Kulturzentrum\n Solingen Camii (Verband der Islamischen Kulturzentren, VIKZ)\n\nMain sights\n\n Burg Castle, the castle of the counts of Berg\n Müngsten Bridge, a railway bridge connecting Solingen with the neighbour town of Remscheid.

The club was founded in 1991 and the first men's team was promoted to the first division of the Baseball Bundesliga for the 2003 season. It has played there in every season since, winning the league championship in 2006 and 2014. The club claims over 250 members.\n\nChess\nThe Schachgesellschaft Solingen e.V. 1868 is best known for its chess team, which plays in the Schachbundesliga (Chess Bundesliga), the top tier of the German chess league system, and is the most successful club in German chess history, having won a record 12 national titles (1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1980\/81, 1986\/87, 1987\/88, 1996\/97 and 2015\/16), three national cups (1986, 2006 und 2009) and 2 European cups (1976 and 1990).\n\nHandball\nIn handball, Solingen's most successful team is Bergischer HC, playing in the top-tier Handball-Bundesliga which they were promoted to for the second time in 2013, reaching 15th place in the 2013–14 campaign and therefore staying in the top flight for a second consecutive season. BHC originates from a 2006 cooperation between the SG Solingen and rivals LTV Wuppertal from the nearby city of the same name. The club advertises itself as a representative of the entire Bergisches Land region. The team plays its home games at both Solingen's Klingenhalle (2,600 seats) and Wuppertal's Uni-Halle (3,200 seats).\n\nReception\n\nIn May 1955, the city of Solingen took over the partnership of the German general cargo ship Solingen of the Hamburg-American Packet Transit Actien-Gesellschaft (Hapag).\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\nSolingen is twinned with:\n\n Gouda, Netherlands (1957)\n Chalon-sur-Saône, France (1960)\n Cramlington, England, United Kingdom (1962)\n Jinotega, Nicaragua (1985)\n Ness Ziona, Israel (1986)\n Thiès, Senegal (1990)\n Aue, Germany (1990)\n\nSince 1990, Solingen also sponsors Złotoryja County in Poland.\n\nNotable people\n\nJohann Wilhelm Meigen (1764–1845), entomologist\nJ.

Here, we\ninvestigate the properties of a strikingly different surfactant: a\ntwo-dimensional and covalent layer with close atomic packing, graphene. Using\nin situ, real time electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, kinetic\nMonte Carlo simulations, and continuum mechanics calculations, we reveal why\nmetallic atomic layers can grow in a two-dimensional manner below an\nimpermeable graphene membrane. Upon metal growth, graphene dynamically opens\nnanochannels called wrinkles, facilitating mass transport, while at the same\ntime storing and releasing elastic energy via lattice distortions. Graphene\nthus behaves as a mechanically active, deformable surfactant. The\nwrinkle-driven mass transport of the metallic layer intercalated between\ngraphene and the substrate is observed for two graphene-based systems,\ncharacterized by different physico-chemical interactions, between graphene and\nthe substrate, and between the intercalated material and graphene. The\ndeformable surfactant character of graphene that we unveil should then apply to\na broad variety of species, opening new avenues for using graphene as a\ntwo-dimensional surfactant forcing the growth of flat films, nanostructures and\nunconventional crystalline phases.\n",

I hope you put this letter into consideration when making your decision on the policy.  First of all, it might be useful to use your cell phone in lunch or the like  You can call your parents to get you your homework if you forgot it, or just stop by and say hello. You can also talk to friends you don't normally see at school via text message. It's a great way to connect with people during lunch.  Second, using your cell phone during lunch is a waste of a detention or confiscation.  Students question why they can't use their cell phone during lunch if it's not going to hurt anyone. The idea of getting a detention for using your MP3 or cell phone during lunch is questionable to me. Like I said before, the cell phone does not disturb the peace in the lunchroom. It's like arresting someone for a public disturbance at a rock concert. The environment in the lunchroom is loud, and I don't see how that \"disturbs the peace.\"\n I'm sure that everyone will agree with me that there is no problem in using a cell phone in the lunchroom will harm no one.

        "text":" A football will tell you how much pressure to use when inflating it in one of two units of measurement: BAR or P.S.I. This number is often printed around the valve or will be included in the football’s instruction manual. If your football is worn and the number is not visible, you can use the size of the football to estimate the BAR or P.S.I.:\n\n\nSize 5: 0.8 - 1.0 BAR (11.6 - 14.5 P.S.I)\nSize 4: 0.7 - 0.8 BAR (10.1 - 11.6 P.S.I.)\nSize 3: 0.5 - 0.7 BAR (7.2 - 10.1 P.S.I.)\n1 BAR = 14.5 P.S.I.;\n, This is necessary to do if the ball is completely flat or very deflated. Roll the ball around with your hands so it is less wrinkled and less folded.\n\n, The bladder is an inner tube that you do not want to puncture when inserting the long needle into the valve (the black circle with a hole in the center). If you hold the football up, shake it around, and tap it, you will be able to move the bladder away from the valve.\n\n, By doing so, the bladder will hang directly underneath the valve, reducing the risk of damage.\n\n, Place 1-2 drops of lubricant directly on the needle, and spread it with your finger so the entire needle is lubricated.You can use specially designed valve products, normally either silicone or glycerin sprays. If you do not have valve lubricant, dip the needle in water.\n\n, There will be an attachment on your air pump’s hose where the needle attaches. Insert the needle into this area of the pump. Where the needle attaches may vary according to the make and model of your pump.\n\n, It should slide in with little resistance, but you may have to exert some force to get it in. Once the needle is entirely in the valve, you can turn the air pump on to begin inflating the football.\n\n, Use the air pump until the gauge on the pump shows the necessary BAR or P.S.I. For example, if your football should be at 0.5 - 0.7 BAR (7.2 - 10.1 P.S.I.), keep the pump on until the gauge is between those numbers.\n\n\nThe gauge will have a needle that shows what BAR or P.S.I. it is currently at.\nDo not over-inflate the ball by going over the recommended BAR or P.S.I.\n\n, Once the desired pressure has been reached, you can turn off the air pump and remove the needle. Pulling the needle out quickly will prevent any air from escaping.\n\n, Each time you use your football, check the BAR or P.S.I. Keeping the football at its optimal pressure is essential to keep your football in peak condition.\n\n, Throwing the football at a wall or asphalt will damage it, and a broken football is difficult to restore. Kick, throw, and catch the football, but never throw it at hard surfaces such as concrete or asphalt.\n\n, Use a wet cloth or towel to remove mud or dirt from the football. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as this can damage the stitching and outer layer of the ball.\n\n, Between uses, store the football somewhere cool and dry.\n\n",

Electoral College was a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  I am writing to the state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is a way of certainty of outcome.  Swing states  Aviod run-off elections.  This has happened before in 2000. In 2012 election, for Obama he received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. electoral votes arenon a winner-takes-all basis. A tie in the nationwide electora vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number.  The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. \n The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes.  To briefly wrap up I argue in favor for the Electoral Votes to stay because of the certainty of outcome, swing states, and lastly to aviod run-off elections. In some people's opinion's they would disagree, but they will not have enough facts to support why they disagree, because honestly Electoral Votes is always the way to go.      ",

Shown a board position for a very brief period of time, a chess master can reconstruct it from memory with much greater accuracy than a novice. However, if pieces are randomly arranged on the board, then experts are just as bad as novices. This was taken to indicate that the difference between experts and novices is that experts are able to rapidly extract features and detect patterns or structure in arrangements of chess positions, forming simpler representational units that can be encoded faster and with greater accuracy. These are typical characteristics of perceptual learning and exist in many domains of expertise, e.g. bird watchers, radiologists, etc. \n\nSee Chase and Simon's chapter in *Visual information processing* (1973) and *Thought and choice in chess* by de Groot (1946\/1978). The latter work showed that there was no difference between masters and controls in general cognitive abilities, only this memory difference for board positions. Another useful resource could be *The psychology of chess skill* by Holding (1985). \n\n(as an aside - I feel that this question is more appropriate for psychology than neuroscience…)\n\nedit: grammar x2",

        "text":"In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion (or sample) of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds or entire bars of music, and may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware (samplers) or software such as digital audio workstations.\n\nA process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with musique concrète, experimental music created by splicing and looping tape. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played sounds recorded on tape, such as the Mellotron. The term sampling was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the Fairlight CMI, a synthesizer with the ability to record and play back short sounds. As technology improved, cheaper standalone samplers with more memory emerged, such as the E-mu Emulator, Akai S950 and Akai MPC.\n\nSampling is a foundation of hip hop music, which emerged with 1980s producers sampling funk and soul records, particularly drum breaks. It has since influenced many genres of music, particularly electronic music and pop. Samples such as the Amen break, the \"Funky Drummer\" drum break and orchestra hit have been used in thousands of recordings; James Brown, Loleatta Holloway, Fab Five Freddy and Led Zeppelin are among the most sampled artists. The first album created entirely from samples, Endtroducing by DJ Shadow, was released in 1996.\n\nSampling without permission can infringe copyright or may be fair use. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as clearance, and can be complex and costly; samples from well known sources may be prohibitively expensive. Courts have taken different positions on whether sampling without permission is permitted. In Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc (1991) and Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films (2005), the courts ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes copyright infringement; however, VMG Salsoul v Ciccone (2016) found that unlicensed samples constituted de minimis copying, and did not infringe copyright.\n\nPrecursors \n\nIn the 1940s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer developed musique concrète, an experimental form of music created by recording sounds to tape, splicing them, and manipulating them to create sound collages. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils. The method also involved tape loops, splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely. Schaeffer developed the Phonogene, which played loops at 12 different pitches triggered by a keyboard.\n\nComposers including John Cage, Edgar Varèse, Karheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis experimented with musique concrète, and Bebe and Louis Barron used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film Forbidden Planet. Musique concrète was brought to a mainstream audience by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which used the techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including Doctor Who.\n\nIn the 1960s, Jamaican dub reggae producers such as King Tubby and Lee \"Scratch\" Perry began using recordings of reggae rhythms to produce riddim tracks, which were then deejayed over. Jamaican immigrants introduced the techniques to American hip hop music in the 1970s. British producer Brian Eno cited German musician Holger Czukay's experiments with Dictaphones and shortwave radios as examples of early sampling.\n\nSamplers \n\nThe Guardian described the Chamberlin as the first sampler, developed by the English engineer Harry Chamberlin in the 1940s. The Chamberlin used a keyboard to trigger a series of tape decks, each containing eight seconds of sound. Similar technology was popularised in the 60s with the Mellotron. In 1969, the English engineer Peter Zinovieff developed the first digital sampler, the EMS Musys.\n\nThe term sample was coined by Kim Ryrie and Peter Vogel to describe a feature of their Fairlight CMI synthesizer, launched in 1979. While developing the Fairlight, Vogel recorded around a second of a piano performance from a radio broadcast, and discovered that he could imitate a piano by playing the recording back at different pitches. The result better resembled a real piano than sounds generated by synthesizers.\n\nCompared to later samplers, the Fairlight was limited; it allowed control over pitch and envelope, and could only record a few seconds of sound. However, the sampling function became its most popular feature. Though the concept of reusing recordings in other recordings was not new, the Fairlight's design and built-in sequencer simplified the process. The Fairlight inspired competition, improving sampling technology and driving down prices. Early competitors included the E-mu Emulator and the Akai S950. Drum machines such as the Oberheim DMX and Linn LM-1 incorporated samples of drum kits and percussion rather than generating sounds from circuits. Early samplers could store samples of only a few seconds in length, but this increased with improved memory.\nIn 1988, Akai released the first MPC sampler, which allowed users to assign samples to pads and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a keyboard or drum kit. It was followed by competing samplers from companies including Korg, Roland and Casio. Today, most samples are recorded and edited using digital audio workstations such as Pro Tools and Ableton Live.\n\nImpact \nSampling has influenced many genres of music, particularly pop, hip hop and electronic music; Guardian journalist David McNamee likened its importance in these genres to the guitar's importance in rock. Sampling is a fundamental element of remix culture. Commonly sampled elements include strings, basslines, drum loops, vocal hooks, or entire bars of music, especially from soul records. Samples may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. As sampling technology has improved, the possibilities for manipulation have grown.\n\nEarly works \nUsing the Fairlight, the \"first truly world-changing sampler\", producer Trevor Horn became the \"key architect\" in incorporating sampling into pop music in the 1980s. Other users of the Fairlight included Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby, Duran Duran, Herbie Hancock, Todd Rundgren, Icehouse and Ebn Ozn. In the 1980s, samples were incorporated into synthesizers and music workstations, such as the bestselling Korg M1, released in 1988.\n\nThe Akai MPC, released in 1988, had a major influence on electronic and hip hop music, allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without other instruments, a studio or formal music knowledge. Its designer, Roger Linn, anticipated that users would sample short sounds, such as individual notes or drum hits, to use as building blocks for compositions; however, users sampled longer passages of music. In the words of Greg Milner, author of Perfecting Sound Forever, musicians \"didn't just want the sound of John Bonham's kick drum, they wanted to loop and repeat the whole of 'When the Levee Breaks'.\" Linn said: \"It was a very pleasant surprise. After 60 years of recording, there are so many prerecorded examples to sample from. Why reinvent the wheel?\"\n\nStevie Wonder's 1979 album Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants may have been the first album to make extensive use of samples. The Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra were pioneers in sampling, constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them; their album Technodelic (1981) is an early example of an album consisting mostly of samples. My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981) by David Byrne and Brian Eno is another important early work of sampling, incorporating samples of sources including Arabic singers, radio DJs and an exorcist. Musicians had used similar techniques before, but, according to Guardian writer Dave Simpson, sampling had never before been used \"to such cataclysmic effect\". Eno felt the album's innovation was to make samples \"the lead vocal\". Big Audio Dynamite pioneered sampling in rock and pop with their 1985 album This Is Big Audio Dynamite.\n\nHip hop \nSampling is one of the foundations of hip hop, which emerged in the 1980s. Hip hop sampling has been likened to the origins of blues and rock, which were created by repurposing existing music. Guardian journalist David McNamee wrote that, in the 1980s, sampling in hip hop had been a political act, the \"working-class black answer to punk\".\n\nBefore the rise of sampling, DJs used turntables to loop breaks from records, which MCs would rap over. Compilation albums such as Ultimate Breaks and Beats compiled tracks with drum breaks and solos intended for sampling, and were aimed at DJs and hip hop producers. In 1986, the tracks \"South Bronx\", \"Eric B. is President\" and \"It's a Demo\" sampled the funk and soul tracks of James Brown, particularly a drum break from \"Funky Drummer\", helping popularize the technique. \n\nThe advent of affordable samplers such as the Akai MPC (1988) made looping easier. With a ten-second sample length and a distinctive \"gritty\" sound, the E-mu SP-1200, released in 1987, was used extensively by East Coast producers during the golden age of hip hop of the late 1980s and early 90s. Guinness World Records cites DJ Shadow's acclaimed hip hop album Endtroducing (1996), made almost entirely on an MPC60, as the first album created entirely from samples.\n\nCommon samples \n\n \nA seven-second drum break in the 1969 track \"Amen, Brother\", known as the Amen break, became popular with American hip hop producers and then British jungle producers in the early 1990s. It has been used in thousands of recordings, including songs by rock bands such as Oasis and in theme tunes for television shows such as Futurama. According to WhoSampled, a user-generated website cataloging samples, \"Amen, Brother\" is the most sampled track in history, appearing in over 5000 tracks as of 2021. \n\nIn 2018, the Smithsonian cited the most sampled track as \"Change the Beat\" by Fab Five Freddy, which appears in more than 1,150 tracks. WhoSampled cites James Brown as the most sampled artist, appearing in more than 3000 tracks. The Independent named the American singer Loleatta Holloway \"the most sampled female voice in popular music\"; her vocals were sampled in house and dance tracks such as \"Ride on Time\" by Black Box, the bestselling single of 1989.\n\nThe drum break from the 1970 James Brown song \"Funky Drummer\" is one of the most influential samples. The 1972 Lyn Collins song \"Think (About It)\", written by Brown, includes another widely sampled drum break, featuring the cries \"Woo!\" \"Yeah!\" by Brown and Bobby Byrd. The drums in Led Zeppelin's recording of \"When the Levee Breaks\", played by John Bonham, is another of the most widely sampled drum breaks, used by artists including the Beastie Boys, Dr. Dre, Eminem and Massive Attack. \n\nThe orchestra hit originated as a sound on the Fairlight sampled from Stravinsky's 1910 orchestral work Firebird Suite and became a hip hop cliche. MusicRadar cited the Zero-G Datafiles sample libraries as a major influence on dance music in the early 90s, becoming the \"de facto source of breakbeats, bass and vocal samples\".\n\nLegal and ethical issues \nTo legally use a sample, an artist must acquire legal permission from the copyright holder, a potentially lengthy and complex process known as clearance. Sampling without permission can breach the copyright of the original sound recording, of the composition and lyrics, and of the performances, such as a rhythm or guitar riff. The moral rights of the original artist may also be breached if they are not credited or object to the sampling. In some cases, sampling is protected under American fair use laws, which grant \"limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holder\".Richard Lewis Spencer, who owned the copyright for the widely sampled Amen break, never received royalties for its use; he condemned the sampling as plagiarism, but later said it was flattering. Journalist Simon Reynolds likened the situation to \"the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children\". In 1989, the Turtles sued De La Soul for using an uncleared sample on their album 3 Feet High and Rising. Turtles singer Mark Volman told the Los Angeles Times: \"Sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honestly say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative.\" The case was settled out of court and set a legal precedent that had a chilling effect on sampling in hip hop.\n\nIn 1991, songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan sued rapper Biz Markie after he sampled O'Sullivan's \"Alone Again (Naturally)\" on the album I Need a Haircut. The court ruled that sampling without permission infringed copyright. Instead of asking for royalties, O'Sullivan forced Biz Markie's label Warner Bros to recall the album until the song was removed. Nelson George described it as the \"most damaging example of anti-hip hop vindictiveness\", which \"sent a chill through the industry that is still felt\". The Washington Post wrote in 2018 that \"no court decision has changed the sound of pop music as much as this\", likening it to banning a musical instrument.\n\nSince the O'Sullivan lawsuit, samples on commercial recordings have typically been taken either from obscure recordings or cleared, an often expensive option only available to successful acts. According to the Guardian, \"Sampling became risky business and a rich man's game, with record labels regularly checking if their musical property had been tea-leafed.\" For less successful artists, the legal implications of using samples pose obstacles; according to Fact, \"For a bedroom producer, clearing a sample can be nearly impossible, both financially and in terms of administration.\"\n\nThe 1989 Beastie Boys album Paul's Boutique is composed almost entirely of samples, most of which were cleared \"easily and affordably\"; the clearance process would be much more expensive today. In 2000, jazz flautist James Newton filed a claim against the Beastie Boys' 1992 single \"Pass the Mic\", which samples his composition \"Choir\". The judge found that the sample, comprising six seconds and three notes, was de minimis and did not require clearance. Newton lost appeals in 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn 2019, the European Court of Justice ruled that producers Moses Pelham and Martin Haas had illegally sampled a drum sequence from the 1977 Kraftwerk track “Metal on Metal\" for the Sabrina Setlur song \"Nur Mir\". The court ruled that permission was required for recognizable samples; modified, unrecognizable samples could still be used without authorisation.\n\nContemporary use \nAccording to Fact, early hip hop sampling was governed by \"unspoken\" rules forbidding the sampling of recent records, reissues, other hip hop records, or from non-vinyl sources, among other restrictions. These rules were relaxed as younger producers took over: \"For many producers today it is no longer a case of 'should I sample this?' but of 'can I get away with sampling this?'. Thus the ethics of sampling unravelled as the practice became ever more ubiquitous.\"\n\nThe Washington Post described the modern use of well known samples, such as on records by Kanye West, as an act of conspicuous consumption similar to flaunting cars or jewelry. West has been sued several times over his use of samples. Some have accused the law of restricting creativity, while others argue it forces producers to innovate. Sampling can help popularize the sampled work; for example, the Desiigner track \"Panda\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 after West sampled it on \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 2\". Some record labels and other music licensing companies have simplified their clearance processes by \"pre-clearing\" their records. For example, the Los Angeles record label Now-Again Records has cleared songs produced for West and Pusha T in a matter of hours.\n\nRecreating samples \nTo circumvent legal problems, producers may recreate a recording rather than sample it. This requires only the publisher's permission, and gives the artist more freedom to alter constituent components such as separate guitar and drum tracks.\n\nSome producers have opted to use stock library music in their productions as samples. Beginning in the 2000s, some music producers began releasing full compositions with the intention for them to be manipulated by other producers in the tradition of library music. Often released in packs, the compositions are used by beatmakers and offer more than a single sound or musical phrase. Producer Frank Dukes and his Kingsway Music Library is often credited in popularizing the craft; his sample compositions have been used for the likes of Drake's \"0 to 100 \/ The Catch Up\" and Kanye West's \"Real Friends\".\n\nSee also \n Interpolation\n Mashup\n Musical quotation \n Plunderphonics\n Recombinant culture\n Riddim\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nKatz, Mark. \"Music in 1s and 0s: The Art and Politics of Digital Sampling.\"  In Capturing Sound:  How Technology has Changed Music (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), 137–57. \nMcKenna, Tyrone B.

        "text":"Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed by brothers Ron (keyboards) and Russell Mael (vocals) in Los Angeles. The duo is known for their quirky approach to songwriting; their music is often accompanied by sophisticated and acerbic lyrics, often about women, and sometimes containing literary references, and an idiosyncratic, theatrical stage presence, typified by the contrast between Russell's animated, hyperactive frontman antics and Ron's deadpan scowling. Russell Mael has a distinctive wide-ranging voice, while Ron Mael plays keyboards in an intricate and rhythmic style. They have been much more successful in Europe than in their native U.S., though they maintain a loyal cult following in the States.\n\nEarly career highlights included \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" in 1979, resulting from a collaboration with Giorgio Moroder and marking a stylistic shift towards new wave\/synth-pop; \"When I'm With You\", which made the Australian and French Singles Charts in 1980; the single \"I Predict\", which provided Sparks' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single \"Cool Places\" with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way', which was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994.\n\nTheir frequently changing styles and visual presentations have kept the band at the forefront of modern, artful pop music. The 2002 release of Lil' Beethoven, their \"genre-defining opus\", as well as Hello Young Lovers (2006, their 20th studio album), Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008), and their fantasy radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009–2010) brought Sparks renewed critical and commercial success, and saw them continue to \"steer clear of pop conventions\".\n\nIn 2015, the band released an album with Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, as the supergroup FFS, titled FFS. In 2017, returning to a rock-group format, Sparks released Hippopotamus, which entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 7, as did their next album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, released in 2020, bringing their tally of UK Top 10 albums to four. Sparks are involved in two 2021 movies: the French musical Annette, starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, and The Sparks Brothers, a documentary about their fifty-year career, directed by Edgar Wright. At the 2022 Césars which is the French films ceremony, the band received a César for best original music for Annette.\n\nHistory\n\nInception\nBrothers Ron and Russell Mael grew up in Pacific Palisades, in west Los Angeles County, California, during the \"Golden Age\" of the LA club scene, when the Doors, the Standells, and Love played the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip and the Beach Boys played in the late afternoon at  Teen-Age Fair at Pickwick Recreation Center in Burbank, California.\n\nBoth Ron and Russell Mael are seen in the audience during the Ronettes' section of the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, filmed in 1966. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art and Russell, theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered \"cerebral and sedate and we had no time for that\", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as \"Anglophiles\".\n\nTheir very first recordings were made under the name of \"Urban Renewal Project\", on January 14, 1967, at the Fidelity Recording Studios in Hollywood. Four tracks were recorded with married couple Fred and Ronna Frank, who were close friends of the Maels at the time. The songs were pressed on two acetates and have never been released, apart from the track \"Computer Girl\", which was featured on a CD included with the Japanese semi-biography from 2006 and more widely released on the Past Tense greatest hits album in 2019. The other three tracks were entitled \"The Windmill\", \"A Quick Thought\" and \"As You Like It\". Of all four songs, \"Computer Girl\" was the least traditional.\n\nForming Halfnelson, named after a wrestling hold, in 1968, they soon came to the attention of producer Todd Rundgren, at whose urging Albert Grossman signed the band to his Bearsville record label. Their debut album was released on Bearsville Records in 1971 with the line-up consisting of college friend Earle Mankey on guitar, Mankey's brother James on bass, Harley Feinstein on drums and Rundgren producing. It sold poorly. The Whole Burbank Catalog, a 1972 Warner Brothers $2, 2-LP loss leader sampler included, \"Biology II\". After renaming themselves Sparks in 1972, a play on the Marx Brothers, the album was then re-released by Bearsville Records in 1972 as Sparks. The re-issued debut spawned the minor regional hit \"Wonder Girl\".\n\nTheir follow-up album, A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing, led to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee Club in London, These London appearances helped them to secure a significant cult following.\n\nEarly 1970s\n\nRelocating to England in 1973 with a new manager, John Hewlett, founder of John's Children, and a deal from Island Records, thanks in part to the exposure garnered by their BBC Two Whistle Test performance, they placed an ad in music weekly Melody Maker (\"Wanted bass player for Sparks.  Must be beard free and exciting\") and through this hired Martin Gordon. With Adrian Fisher on guitar and Norman \"Dinky\" Diamond on drums, in the midst of power cuts and a threatened vinyl shortage, they recorded their breakthrough Kimono My House in 1974, scoring a No. 2 hit with the single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\".\n\nSparks became a UK teen sensation appearing on the cover of Melody Maker, Record Mirror and countless other pop magazines in the UK and Europe. Hits such as \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", \"Amateur Hour\" and \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" led to many appearances on the BBC's flagship music show Top of the Pops. Russell's hyperactive movements were in sharp contrast to the keyboard-bound, soberly dressed Ron's expressionless squint and Charlie Chaplin-esque moustache.\n\nGordon and Fisher were later replaced by Trevor White and Ian Hampton. In 1975, the revised band returned to the US to tour supporting the Kimono and Propaganda albums which had gained strong cult attention in New York City, Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles primarily from FM radio play and a national TV appearance on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. Flo & Eddie were the supporting act. Influential 1970s progressive FM radio station powerhouse WMMS in Cleveland and its famed DJs such as Kid Leo initially championed the band in America. Sparks also performed on American Bandstand in 1975 with host Dick Clark mugging with Ron and on countless other TV shows in the US and abroad post 1977.\n\nThe follow-up albums, Propaganda and Indiscreet, the latter produced by Tony Visconti, were similarly successful and produced the hit singles \"Looks, Looks, Looks\", \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" and \"Something for the Girl with Everything\".\n\nReturn home\nThe Maels returned home to Los Angeles in 1976. Concerned that their music may have become stale, they adopted a more \"American\" sound and recorded Big Beat with Rupert Holmes and Jeffrey Lesser on production, which they followed with Introducing Sparks; both albums were mostly recorded with session musicians. This new \"West Coast\" sound yielded such songs as \"Nothing to Do\", \"Everybody's Stupid\", and \"Throw Her Away (and Get a New One)\". In 1976, Sparks made one of their first forays into the movie business, making a cameo appearance in the disaster-suspense film Rollercoaster, after Kiss turned down the roles. They performed the songs \"Fill 'Er Up\" and \"Big Boy\".\n\nBy 1977 the brothers found themselves at a crossroads. They had grown tired of recording within a traditional rock band framework and were determined to take their music in a more electronic direction. In a conversation with a German journalist, they expressed their admiration for Giorgio Moroder, a pioneer of electronic disco and pop music. Moroder happened to be a friend of the journalist, and he was able to connect the brothers with the Italian producer, who produced their next album, No. 1 in Heaven. More synthesizer-based than their previous efforts, the album would redefine Sparks' sound and challenge the concept of what is meant by a band, and it also became a major influence on emerging electronic pop artists. It spawned two singles in the top-fifteen UK chart: \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" and \"Beat The Clock\". The follow-up album in 1980, Terminal Jive, had a hit single in France, \"When I'm With You\", which led to the Maels staying in the country for a year promoting the album, during which Russell became conversationally fluent in French. The single also hit the Top 20 in Australia, reaching No.14. \nIn 1981, Belgian synth pop group Telex enlisted Sparks to help write the lyrics for their third album, Sex.\n\nFinding the electronic equipment that they had adopted for their new sound too cumbersome for touring, the band returned to the more conventional band format for their next three releases, although they did not eschew synthesizers entirely: Whomp That Sucker, Angst in My Pants, (two tracks from which appear later in the 1983 movie Valley Girl) and In Outer Space. They broke into the US singles chart once more, reaching No. 49 with \"Cool Places\" from 1983's In Outer Space. The track was a collaboration with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin (who at one time ran her own Sparks fan club), and its success was in part thanks to Los Angeles' KROQ-FM radio station, which hailed them as local heroes. In 1984, the Maels wrote and performed several original songs on the soundtrack for the black comedy teen film Bad Manners (aka: Growing Pains), including the film's title song, \"Bad Manners\". In 1989, they scored a hit single in France and in Europe with \"Singing in the Shower\", sung in duet with Rita Mitsouko: the single was produced by Tony Visconti. \n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga Mai, the Psychic Girl into a musical, with interest from Tim Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood for Touchstone Pictures. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's Columbia Pictures. The release of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a \"second wind\", vocalist Russell Mael explained. \"The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day.\" On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.\n\n1990s – A new beginning\nIn 1993, Ron and Russell returned with the single \"National Crime Awareness Week\", their first release since the 1988 album Interior Design. The song was produced by the Scottish dance band Finitribe. In 1994, the Maels released Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, providing the hit singles \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way' and \"When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)\". In Germany, \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way was the No. 1 airplay song for 1994 as well as being hailed critically for its poignant lyrics and touching melody. The band toured in support of the album with percussionist Christi Haydon playing drums. Haydon also appeared in the videos for \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'\" and \"When I Kiss You (I Hear Charlie Parker Playing)\", which were both directed by Sophie Muller.\n\n1997 saw the release of Plagiarism, an album of cover versions of their own songs featuring collaborations with Faith No More, Erasure and Jimmy Somerville. Half of the album was recorded by Tony Visconti in London with the other half recorded by the brothers in their own purpose-built studio in LA, surrounded by busts of Elvis. In 1998 they recorded the soundtrack for the action film Knock Off, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by the acclaimed Hong Kong-based producer\/director Tsui Hark (who had appeared on his own tribute song by the band on the album Gratuitous Sax and Senseless Violins).\n\nBalls, released in 2000, again put the band in a context of electronic instrumentation with some of Ron's most striking and perceptive lyrics. With the release of Balls the band toured the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia.\n\n2000s\nAfter Balls, the band resurfaced in 2002 with the release of an album described as their \"genre-defining opus\" – Lil' Beethoven, featuring quasi-classical arrangements of strings and choirs. Lil' Beethoven led to renewed interest in the band. Record Collector magazine named the album as one of its \"Best New Albums of 2002\", describing it as \"...possibly the most exciting and interesting release ever from such a long-established act\" and later in 2003 saying \"...it really does feel like one of the best albums ever made.\" A UK and European tour had the band playing the entire album each night in the first half of the show, with fan favourites making up the second. The line-up now included former Faith No More guitarist Dean Menta in addition to Tammy Glover on drums. Long-time fan Morrissey invited Sparks to perform at the 2004 Meltdown Festival, of which he was curator. They performed their breakthrough Kimono My House album, followed by Lil Beethoven, both in their entirety. Also in this period, the duo appeared in the music video for the Darkness' Justin Hawkins's cover of \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", in which Ron and Russell play the referee and MC at a darts match between Hawkins and darts champion Phil Taylor. This version of \"This Town\" reached No.6 in the UK charts. Sparks would later release Lil' Beethoven's closing track Suburban Homeboy as a single.\n\nFebruary 2006 saw the release of Hello Young Lovers, their twentieth studio album. The album is regarded as carrying on where Lil' Beethoven left off, being described as \"...cynical, intelligent and very, very funny\", it has met with considerable acclaim. Sparks led off the album with the striking tune that the BBC deemed too provocative in its title to play, \"Dick Around\". The song is a multi-section, multi-mood, highly layered track that many felt should have been a UK smash hit had the BBC not misinterpreted the title of the song as being other than it was.\n\nThe brothers tend to be dismissive of the latest trends in popular music, seeing most current bands as lacking musical ambition and experimental drive. Indeed, the predictable trends in much of modern rock, as they see it, served as inspiration for their latest album. However, they have expressed admiration for Eminem and Morrissey.\n\nThe pair appeared in the season 6 finale of the US TV show Gilmore Girls, performing \"Perfume\" from the album Hello Young Lovers. They released a live DVD of a September 2006 show at The Forum as well as a long-awaited CD release of their previously unavailable 1977 album Introducing Sparks. The track \"Perfume\" was featured in a Dolce & Gabbana TV commercial in 2009.\n\nOn May 12, 2008, Sparks released the single \"Good Morning\", taken from the album Exotic Creatures of the Deep.\n\nMay and June 2008 saw the 21-night \"Sparks Spectacular\" in London, where they played each of their albums in chronological order during the first twenty nights and premiered their new album on the twenty-first concert on June 13, 2008. Each night, they performed an album in its entirety followed by a rare track– many of the songs had never been performed live before. The band asked their fans to visit their website and vote for the track that they'd most like to hear the band perform during the second half of the 21st concert after the premiere of Exotic Creatures of the Deep, though Russell admitted that he and Ron would probably influence the poll a little.\n\nFans who bought a \"Golden Ticket\" (which allowed entry into all 21 gigs) also received a poster signed by the band and a CD single entitled \"Islington N1\", a reference to the postal address of the venue for the first 20 gigs. The song \"Islington N1\" was later made available in the box set edition of their \"New Music For Amnesiacs\" career-spanning box set.\n\nIn 2009 the band played two consecutive nights at The Forum on 20 and 21 March. They played Exotic Creatures of the Deep in its entirety at both gigs, followed by Kimono My House in its entirety on the first night and No.1 in Heaven in its entirety on the second night.\n\nValentine's Day evening 2009 saw Sparks perform the same show featuring their Exotic Creatures of the Deep and Kimono My House albums played in their entirety before a sold-out hometown crowd at Royce Hall at the Mael Bros. alma mater in Los Angeles, UCLA.\n\nRon and Russell appeared as interview subjects in the 2009 documentary The Magnificent Tati, discussing their involvement during the early 1980s in Confusion, a proposed Jacques Tati movie for which a screenplay was written but never shot (due to Tati's death).\n\nThe Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009)\n\nOn August 14, 2009, the band premiered the radio musical The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, commissioned by the Swedish public radio (SR) and featuring the Mael brothers themselves and Swedish actors Elin Klinga and Jonas Malmsjö, both of whom worked with Bergman in his lifetime. The musical, partly in English, partly in Swedish, tells the story of Bergman's relocation to Hollywood after his breakthrough with Smiles of a Summer Night (1956), and the surreal and discomforting encounter with the movie capital. On October 28, 2009, the UK's BBC Radio 6 Music held a similar event in London whereby the musical was played in its entirety before a live audience at the BBC Broadcasting House in London and later to be broadcast with a Q&A with the Maels. In interviews for Swedish newspapers, the band said they hoped to be able to theatrically stage the musical as well as turn the musical into a feature film. Amongst the filmmakers cited as undertaking The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman with the Mael Brothers is Canadian avant-garde director Guy Maddin.\n\nOn June 25, 2011, as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, Sparks presented the World Premiere live performance of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Canadian film director Guy Maddin provided directions based on the screenplay, with Ron and Russell reprising their recorded roles on stage. The role of Ingmar Bergman was performed by Finnish movie actor Peter Franzén and American actress Ann Magnuson portrayed the role of Greta Garbo. The show was held at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. The group showcased at the film festival in their quest for funding for the feature film version. The performance garnered glowing reviews from journals such as The Huffington Post, the LA Times, the LA Weekly, and LA Record.\n\nSince 2011, the band have been pursuing the idea of turning The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman into a feature film. Originally envisaged as a live-action film, in 2017, the Mael Brothers announced they were taking a new direction and developing Bergman as an animated feature film with director Joseph Wallace, who created the music video for their track \"Edith Piaf (Said It Better Than Me)\".\n\n2010s\nIn 2010, Sparks remixed Yoko Ono's song \"Give Me Something\". In July they contributed a remix of sorts to singer Katie Melua's single, A Happy Place, calling it Sparks VS. Melua. September 2 marked the debut of the new theme songs that Ron and Russell have composed and recorded for NPR radio's Bookworm show, broadcast in Los Angeles on station KCRW. The two songs mark the first time in 21 years that the Bookworm show has used a new theme song, these being commissioned by show host and Sparks fan Michael Silverblatt. The compositions were entitled \"Where Would We Be Without Books?\" and \"I Am A Bookworm\".\n\nFor the encore of what may have been the final live date ever in America for Faith No More on December 1 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, Ron and Russell Mael were invited by Mike Patton and Co. to perform the Sparks' classic hit \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\". They reprised the song that also appears as a collaboration with Faith No More on Sparks' 1997 album Plagiarism and had also been released as a single.\n\nIn 2012 Ron and Russell collaborated with singer Gemma Ray who released a limited 12-inch single titled \"Gemma Ray Sings Sparks (with Sparks)\", which included Ray's covers of Sparks' \"How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall\" and \"Eaten by the Monster of Love\". Though the songs were covers sung by Ray, they were arranged and produced by the Maels. In October, Ron and Russell performed for the first time ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled \"Two Hands One Mouth\" began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The final UK concert of the tour was at the sold-out Barbican Centre in London. The tour then took the group to Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka in January 2013. In April 2013, the show was presented for the first time in the US with two performances at the Coachella Festival. A short US tour with shows in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Philadelphia followed. In May 2013 Ron and Russell played the show in Paris, France, which coincided with their visit to the Cannes Film Festival. In Paris, they were joined on stage by Catherine Ringer from Les Rita Mitsouko to sing on their 1989 collaboration \"Singing in The Shower\".\n\nSparks first live album, Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe was released in 2013. It contains concert recordings gathered from various cities during the October 2012 European tour. In Fall Ron and Russell continued touring in the duo format for a second round. The tour was titled \"The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth\". The two-and-a-half-month tour started with shows in the US and Canada. Sparks played in Los Angeles (The Fonda Theatre), New York City (Webster Hall), Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Mountain Oasis Electronic Summit in Asheville, Atlanta, Boston, Washington D.C. (9:30 Club), Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, and Pontiac. The tour then continued to Europe, where they played three nights at Union Chapel in London (where Thurston Moore (ex-Sonic Youth joined them to play guitar on \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" on one of the nights), as well as additional shows in the UK, Switzerland, France, Spain, and Sweden.\n\nBoth \"Two Hands One Mouth\" and \"The Revenge of Two Hands One Mouth\" tours were critically well received.\n\nIn 2013 they contributed a song and brief voice part to the Guy Maddin movie The Forbidden Room.\n\nIn February 2014 it was announced the Sparks (Ron and Russell) are working on material with Franz Ferdinand.\n\n2014 marked the 40th Anniversary of Sparks' most popular and most influential album, Kimono My House. They performed the album in its entirety at the Barbican Centre in London on 19 and 20 December. The album was performed with the 35-piece Heritage Orchestra. The show included a second-half consisting of songs from Sparks' entire career, that were also orchestrated for the show. The first night sold out within the first few hours. On the second night, they announced that they had completed the recording of their new album. Ron and Russell took the Kimono My House celebrations to Los Angeles as they performed the album on two consecutive nights with a 38-piece orchestra at the United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel Los Angeles on Valentine's Day 14 February and on 15 February 2015. The orchestra was conducted by Suzie Katayama. Both shows sold out and they received glowing reviews. Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand joined them on stage for duet with Russell on the song \"When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way on both nights and it was then announced that Sparks and FF had joined forces to form a new, then yet-to-be-revealed band and to record an album.\n\nIn the fall of 2015 the title track from Angst in My Pants was used in a commercial for men's underwear by retailer Tommy John. The ad was titled \"The Big Adjustment\" and depicted men, from various walks of life, attempting to secretly adjust their ill-fitting underwear to humorous effect.\n\nFFS (2015)\n\nOn March 9, 2015, it was announced that the band had formed a supergroup with Franz Ferdinand under the name FFS. A short teaser of the FFS song, \"The Power Couple\", was released on the group's YouTube channel. The alternative meaning behind the band's name \"Franz Ferdinand \/ Sparks\" was confirmed with a clip of the musicians playing the \"Chinese Whispers\" (game). It was also confirmed that the band would be releasing a studio album in 2015 with producer John Congleton and that the band would be touring in the summer. On April 1, it was announced that the group's new album would be titled FFS and that it would be released on June 8 in the UK and on June 9 in the US. They are featured on the Beck album Song Reader doing an ethereal rendition of his song \"Why Did You Make Me Care\". Recently, they performed on the Glastonbury Festival John Peel Stage, 28 June 2015.\n\nHippopotamus (2017)\n\nOn March 24, 2017, Sparks performed at the BBC Radio 6 Music Festival in Glasgow, Scotland, prior to the release of a new studio album, Hippopotamus due out in September. The band, consisting of the Mael brothers with 5 other musicians, kicked off their 2017 tour in Copenhagen on August 7. Hippopotamus was both a critical and commercial success, peaking at number 7 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nIn 2019, Sparks collaborated with and were featured on French artist Sebastian's album, Thirst on the track, \"Handcuffed to a Parking Meter\". In July, the band Sparks announced that they were working on a new album. \"Please Don't Fuck Up My World\", the first single, was released in December.\n\n2020s\n\nA Steady Drip, Drip, Drip (2020)\nIn January 2020, Sparks announced the upcoming release of their new album, A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip, comprising 14 songs. A UK and European tour was scheduled for October. The single \"Self-Effacing\", was released in February followed by \"I'm Toast\" in March. The album had its digital release on May 15, 2020, with the physical release pushed back to July 3, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; like its predecessor, Hippopotamus, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 7 and garnered universal critical acclaim. Coinciding with the physical release of the album, an official music video for the song \"The Existential Threat\" premiered on YouTube, the animation created by English freelance animator and composer Cyriak Harris. The band then collaborated with Todd Rundgren on the single \"Your Fandango\", 50 years after he produced their debut album.\n\nAnnette, The Sparks Brothers and tour (2021-present)\nSparks were involved in two 2021 film releases, as screenwriters and composers for the musical Annette, directed by Leos Carax and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, and in The Sparks Brothers, a documentary about their career directed by Edgar Wright. Annette premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and was in competition for the Palme d'Or. The leading track \"So May We Start\" was accompagned by a video featuring the band with Driver and Cotillard, and the Annette soundtrack was released on Sony.\n\nThe band have announced that they will be on tour in North America, in the UK and in Europe in 2022. This will be their longest US tour for decades. The 2022 European tour will consist mainly of concerts postponed in 2020 and 2021. In February Sparks played two sold-out shows at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, their first full concerts since 2018. Variety lauded the concert as \"a rousingly celebratory homecoming\",\n\nAt the 2022 Césars which is France's equivalent to the Oscars, the band received a Cesar for best original music for Annette.\n\nStyle\nSparks is generally regarded as an art pop band.\nTheir musical style has varied dramatically with Russell Mael's distinctive wide-ranging voice (in particular his far-reaching falsetto) and Ron Mael's intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style being the common thread throughout their fifty-year career. In its review of Kimono My House, NME described Russell's falsetto as a \"stratospheric blend of Marc Bolan and Tiny Tim\". In the beginning, they attempted to emulate the sound of their English idols, such as the Who, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and the Kinks, sometimes even pretending to be an English band while on the LA club circuit. They relocated to England during the glam rock era where, despite cutting an odd figure on this scene, they found success with their polished brand of intricate pop tunes and convoluted lyrics. Early albums such as Kimono My House combined glam rock with elements of bubblegum pop and baroque music. By the second half of the decade, they were concerned that the sound they had developed while based in England was in danger of becoming stale; they returned to LA, determined to adopt a more \"West Coast\" sound. This they achieved with producer Rupert Holmes on Big Beat and (sans Holmes) on Introducing Sparks.\n\nThe band were not satisfied with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record No.1 in Heaven which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's Interior Design. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn back in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 2002, the band switched to a classically influenced art pop style with the release of their album Lil' Beethoven, replacing the beat-driven synth-pop of their previous albums with complex orchestral arrangements. The band acknowledged this change in style on the album's opening track \"The Rhythm Thief\".\n\nLyrically, the band's style has been described as coming from \"the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre\". Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On \"My Baby's Taking Me Home\" of Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, \"Your Call Is Very Important To Us\", uses a corporation style call-hold message: \"Your call is very important to us.  Please hold\" which is then sung with some additional words: \"At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold.\" The only other lyrics in the song are \"Red light\", \"Green light\", \"I'm Getting Mixed Signals\" and \"Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold\". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.\n\nThe vocal sound on the single \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" was criticised as being \"stylised\". This may be because the song was written without any regard for the vocal style of Russell Mael. Ron Mael has explained:\n\n\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\" was written in A, and by God, it'll be sung in A. I just feel that if you're coming up with most of the music, then you have an idea where it's going to go. And no singer is gonna get in my way.\n\nRussell Mael has claimed in reply:\n\nWhen he wrote \"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\", Ron could only play it in that key. It was so much work to transpose the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit in. My voice ain't a \"rock\" voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about \"guts\". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.\n\nLegacy\nSparks has influenced many later genres including synth-pop, new wave, post-punk, and alternative music, influencing a wide range of singers and bands including  Joy Division, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Sonic Youth and Björk.\n\nSteve Jones of the Sex Pistols said that he constantly listened to Kimono My House back in 1974 at Paul Cook's room. \"We'd sit in his bedroom for hours listening to them\".  Joy Division cited \"Number One Song in Heaven\" as a primary influence during the recording of \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\". Joy Division's drummer Stephen Morris stated: \"When we were doing 'Love Will Tear Us Apart', there were two records we were into: Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits and Number One Song in Heaven by Sparks. That was the beginning of getting interested in Giorgio Moroder\". Peter Hook of New Order cited Moroder's production on \"The Number One Song in Heaven\" as a major influence when his band changed musical style to produce electro\/dance-rock songs like \"Temptation\" in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of \"When I'm With You\" that same year in Milano. When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan and composer Martin Gore of Depeche Mode cited them as one of their favorite bands. Gore also later covered \"Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth\" on his Counterfeit e.p. in 1989. Other early electronic acts like the Human League, and Erasure, also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about \"This Town ain't...\": \"There was something about them that was very different. I was immediately fascinated with that song.\"\n\nSparks have also been name-checked by indie pop band the Smiths. Their singer Morrissey named Kimono My House as one of \"his favourite LPs of all time\". Smiths' guitarist and composer Johnny Marr said : \"There's nothing better than commerciality crossed with an interesting mind\" and named \"This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the Both of Us\" as an instance, qualifying it as one of these \"Trojan singles\". Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a version of the first Sparks' success as the opening song of their covers album Through the Looking Glass. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth also included the Sparks' song \"Equator\" in his list of all-time favorite songs. Joey Ramone also mentioned his liking for their records, as did later the group They Might Be Giants. Devo's singer Mark Mothersbaugh described himself as a big \"Ron Mael fan\" and of his look: \"it was so not rock n' roll, in an unexpected way, that you just couldn't help but think that there was something there\". He also listened to Kimono my House during his formative years.\n\nBjörk talked about Kimono my House as one of the records that changed her life. \"[Sparks] were exotic [...], [they] were the most refreshing thing in my life\" when she was eight. \"I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people\". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: \"I saw Sparks play on American Bandstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled,  \"why I love the Sparks\". He said about their music: \"It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then you really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them.\" John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers said that he used to listen to Kimono My House and Propaganda for Adrian Fisher's guitar playing adding, \"I'm sure that it is Ron Mael who told him what to play\".\n\nOther notable acts that have mentioned Sparks include Ween, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, Mark Burgess of the Chameleons, and Cait Brennan.  Electronic band Justice hailed the group saying: \"this is [...] something we like in music, this kind of epic feeling, [...] and we were really inspired by bands like Sparks [...] who have this really operatic sound\". In 2012, synth-pop duo Spray released the song \"Sparks Called and They Want Their Ideas Back\".\n\nIn 1980 Paul McCartney also gave a nod to the band in the music video for \"Coming Up\" in which he appeared mimicking Ron Mael on keyboards.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Cannes Soundtrack Award\n| 2021\n| Annette\n| Best Composer\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Florida Film Critics Circle\n| 2021\n| Annette\n| Best Score\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|César Awards\n| 2022\n| Annette\n| Best Original Music\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Lumières Awards\n| 2022\n| Annette\n| Best Music\n| \n| \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|NME Awards\n| 2022\n| The Sparks Brothers\n| Best Music Film\n| \n|\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n Halfnelson (1971, reissued as Sparks, 1972)\n A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing (1973)\n Kimono My House (1974)\n Propaganda (1974)\n Indiscreet (1975)\n Big Beat (1976)\n Introducing Sparks (1977)\n No. 1 in Heaven (1979)\n Terminal Jive (1980)\n Whomp That Sucker (1981)\n Angst in My Pants (1982)\n In Outer Space (1983)\n Pulling Rabbits Out of a Hat (1984)\n Music That You Can Dance To (1986)\n Interior Design (1988)\n Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins (1994)\n Plagiarism (1997)\n Balls (2000)\n Lil' Beethoven (2002)\n Hello Young Lovers (2006)\n Exotic Creatures of the Deep (2008)\n The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman (2009)\n Hippopotamus (2017)\n A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip (2020)\n Annette (2021, soundtrack)\n\nLive album\n Two Hands, One Mouth: Live in Europe (2012)\n\nCollaborative albums\n FFS (2015) (with Franz Ferdinand as FFS)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n\n1972 establishments in California\nAmerican glam rock musical groups\nIsland Records artists\nMusical groups established in 1972\nMusical groups from Los Angeles\nSibling musical duos\nArt pop musicians\nAmerican synth-pop groups\nSynth-pop new wave musical groups\nColumbia Records artists\nVirgin Records artists\nElektra Records artists\nGut Records artists\nBertelsmann Music Group artists\nRCA Records artists\nAtlantic Records artists\nBearsville Records artists\nIn the Red artists\nAmerican expatriates in the United Kingdom\nAmerican expatriates in France",

        "text":"The sun is shining, there is a slight breeze in the air, and no one is wearing pants that go past their knees. These are all signs that summer break has officially started. Summer break is the time that all students look forward to, as it means that there aren't any more tests to take and homework to complete. It's a time when students can finally have the opportunity to have fun with family and friends without having to worry about academic stress. However, there are some schools that require students to complete summer projects in order for learning to continue during their break. With this, the question that arises is whether schools should make the teacher design the projects or allow for the projects to be student-designed. These summer projects should be student-designed   it gives students the opportunity to develop research skills, choose topics that they find interesting, result in an increase in positive mental health. Suppose a teacher assigns a project with specific guidelines and one topic to develop a solution to. This may make the expectations for the student clear-cut, but this type of project learning limits students in what they can explore. With the ability to design your own project, students learn how to research various topics before deciding on the one they will come up with a project to. Not only does this contribute to the development of enhanced research skills among students, but it prepares them for research in the future. In pursuing higher levels of education, it is crucial that students are knowledgeable on how to research about topics efficiently and accurately. Thus, those research skills are developed from student-designed projects and they benefit current and future educational advancement. when I was in 6th grade I had a summer project of choosing an influential president and explaining what that president did for the country. At the time, I was interested in science instead of history. As a result, this project seemed lackluster and an arduous task to complete over my summer break. However, if I had been given the opportunity to choose a topic that interests me, I would have found the summer project exponentially more exciting and something to look forward to. Many students feel the same way about this, as they wish to choose the topic they will research and create a solution to. Therefore, it is evident that summer projects should be student-designed so that students can have a genuine interest in the project they are completing. Time and time again summer projects are dreaded by students and a task that many do not look forward to. As a result, students are left unhappy during summer break in regards to completing a project their teacher designed. This is either because the project has limitations, is about an uninteresting topic, or is difficult to complete. These factors can leave students feeling demoralized from completing their summer project and can make summer break a dreary time. Despite these conditions that come with teacher-designed projects, these problems can be solved with student-designed projects. When given the chance to explore what interests you and choosing whether any limitations exist regarding your project, inevitably students are inclined to complete summer projects. From the perspective of a student, you have more motivation to work on a self-designed project. This increased motivation correlates to an increase in mental health. When regarding this benefit, summer projects should be student-designed.  Summer is the time to relax and unwind from the stresses of the school year. It's a time of mornings spent sleeping in, afternoons laying out by the pool, and nights sleeping on the roof, counting the stars that gleam in the sky. That is why students look forward to summer break. As a result, schools should not contribute in reversing the association students make between summer break and enjoyment by assigning teacher-designed projects. With the intention of continual learning occurring over summer break, schools should allow projects to be student-designed. It gives students the chance to explore their passions and make new discoveries without any limitations. Teacher-designed projects only serve in holding students back from doing projects that truly hold meaning to them. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the most logical decision schools can make is having summer projects that are student-designed. This will allow students to have a good time in both the academic and non-academic part of their summer break. ",

        "text":"The Duchy of Bohemia, also later referred to in English as the Czech Duchy, () was a monarchy and a principality of the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe during the Early and High Middle Ages. It was formed around 870 by Czechs as part of the Great Moravian realm. Bohemia separated from disintegrating Great Moravia after Duke Spytihněv swore fealty to the East Frankish king Arnulf in 895.\n\nWhile the Bohemian dukes of the Přemyslid dynasty, at first ruling at Prague Castle and Levý Hradec, brought further estates under their control, the Christianization initiated by Saints Cyril and Methodius was continued by the Frankish bishops of Regensburg and Passau. In 973, the Diocese of Prague was founded through the joint efforts of Duke Boleslaus II and Emperor Otto I. Late Duke Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, killed by his younger brother Boleslaus in 935, became the land's patron saint.\n\nWhile the lands were occupied by the Polish king Bolesław I and internal struggles shook the Přemyslid dynasty, Duke Vladivoj received Bohemia as a fief from the hands of the East Frankish king Henry II in 1002 and the duchy became an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire. The Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a hereditary Kingdom of Bohemia, when Duke Ottokar I ensured his elevation by the German king Philip of Swabia in 1198. The Přemyslids remained in power throughout the High Middle Ages, until the extinction of the male line with the death of King Wenceslaus III in 1306.\n\nHistory\nThe lands encompassed by the Bohemian Forest, the Ore Mountains, the Sudetes and the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands were settled by Bohemian tribes about 550. In the 7th century the local Czech people were part of the union led by the Frankish merchant Samo (d. 658). Bohemia as a geographical term, probably derived from the Celtic (Gallic) Boii tribes, first appeared in 9th-century Frankish sources. In 805, Emperor Charlemagne prepared to conquer the lands, invading Bohemia in 805 and laying siege to the fortress of Canburg. However, the Czech forces shirked from open battle and retired into the deep forests to launch guerilla attacks. After forty days the emperor had to withdraw his forces for the lack of supplies. When the Frankish forces returned the next year burning and plundering the Bohemian lands, the local tribes finally had to submit and became dependent on the Carolingian Empire.\n\nGreat Moravia\n\nWhile the Frankish realm disintegrated in the mid-9th century, Bohemia fell under the influence of the Great Moravian state which was established around 830. In 874, the Mojmir duke Svatopluk I reached an agreement with the East Frankish king Louis the German and confirmed his Bohemian dominion. With the fragmentation of Great Moravia under the pressure of the Magyar incursions around 900, Bohemia began to form as an independent principality. Already in 880, the Přemyslid prince Bořivoj from Levý Hradec, initially a deputy of Duke Svatopluk I who had been baptised by the Great Moravian archbishop Methodius of Salonica in 874, moved his residence to Prague Castle and started to subjugate the Vltava Basin.\n\nGreat Moravia briefly regained control over the emerging Bohemian principality upon Bořivoj's death in 888\/890 until, in 895, his son Spytihněv together with the Slavník prince Witizla swore allegiance to the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia in Regensburg. He and his younger brother Vratislaus then ruled over Central Bohemia around Prague. They were able to protect their realm from the Magyar forces which crushed an East Frankish army in the 907 Battle of Pressburg during the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin. Cut off from Byzantium by the Hungarian presence, the Bohemian principality existed as independent state though still in the shadow of East Francia; the dukes paid tribute to the Bavarian dukes in exchange for the confirmation of the peace treaty. Vratislaus' son Wenceslaus, who ruled from 921, was already accepted as head of the Bohemian tribal union; however, he had to cope with the enmity of his neighbour Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and his mighty ally, the Saxon king Henry I of Germany. Wenceslaus maintained his ducal authority by submitting to King Henry in 929, whereafter he was murdered by his brother Boleslaus.\n\nAssuming the Bohemian throne in 935, Duke Boleslaus conquered the adjacent lands of Moravia and Silesia, and expanded farther to Kraków in the east. He offered opposition to Henry's successor King Otto I, stopped paying the tribute, attacked an ally of the Saxons in northwest Bohemia and in 936 moved into Thuringia. After a prolonged armed conflict, King Otto I besieged a castle owned by Boleslaus' son in 950 and Boleslaus finally signed a peace treaty whereby he recognized Otto's suzerainty and promised to resume the payment of the tribute. As the king's ally, his Bohemian troops, together with those of the Kingdom of Germany, fought in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld  and after the defeat of the Magyars received the lands of Moravia in recognition of his services.\n\nOverwhelming the marauding Hungarians had the same benefits for Germans and Czechs. Less obvious is what Boleslav I the Cruel wanted to gain by participating in the war against the Obotrite tribes in far north, when he crushed an uprising of two Slavic dukes (Stojgněv and Nakon) in the Saxon Billung March. Probably Boleslav wanted to ensure that his German neighbors did not interfere with his expansion of Bohemia to the east.\n\nSignificantly, the Bishopric of Prague, founded in 973 during the reign of Duke Boleslaus II, was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Mainz. Thus, at the same time that Přemyslid rulers used the German alliance to consolidate their rule against a perpetually rebellious regional nobility, they struggled to retain their autonomy in relation to the empire. The Bohemian principality was definitively consolidated in 995, when the Přemyslids defeated their Slavník rivals, unified the Czech tribes, and established a form of centralized rule, albeit shaken by internal dynastic struggles.\n\nHoly Roman Empire\n\nIn 1002, Duke Vladivoj was enfeoffed with the Duchy of Bohemia from the hands of King Henry II of Germany. With this act, what had been a fully sovereign duchy became part of the Holy Roman Empire. After Vladivoj died the next year, the Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave invaded Bohemia and Moravia and ruled as Boleslaus IV. In 1004, after the Poles were expelled from Bohemia with help from Henry II, Duke Jaromír received the duchy in fief from the king.\n\nDuke Bretislaus I of Bohemia re-acquired the Moravian lands in 1019 or 1029, which thenceforth were usually ruled by a younger son of the Bohemian duke\/king. About 1031, Bretislaus invaded Hungary to prevent its future expansion and, in 1035, he helped the Emperor against the Lusatians. In 1039, he invaded Poland, captured Poznań and ravaged Gniezno; after that he conquered part of Silesia including Breslau. The destruction of Gniezno pushed the Polish rulers to move their capital to Cracow. In 1040, Bretislaus defeated the German King Henry's invasion into Bohemia in the Battle at Brůdek. However, the next year Henry besieged Bretislaus in Prague and forced him to renounce all of his conquests except Moravia. In 1047, Henry negotiated a peace treaty between Bretislaus and the Poles.\n\nThe son of Bretislaus, Vratislaus II, supported Henry against the Pope, anti-kings, and rebellions in Saxony in his long reign. The Bohemian troops showed conspicuous bravery and, in 1083, he entered Rome with Henry and their armed forces. Henry gave Vratislaus a lifetime appointment as the first King of Bohemia in 1085 out of gratitude. For his successor Bretislaus II foreign policy was largely concerned with the Silesian conflict, when the Poles did not pay a fee for areas once resigned by Bretislaus I.\n\nIn 1147, the Bohemian duke, Vladislaus II, accompanied the German king, Conrad III, on the Second Crusade, but halted his march at Constantinople. Thanks to his military support against northern Italian cities (especially Milan) for the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Vladislaus was elected king of Bohemia on 11 January 1158, becoming the second Bohemian king.\n\nEconomy\nMining of tin and silver began in the Ore mountains in early 12th century.\n\nKingdom of Bohemia\n\nDuring the German civil war between the Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia and his Welf rival Otto IV, Duke Ottokar I of Bohemia decided to support Philip, for which he was awarded with a royal coronation in 1198, this time as a hereditary title. In 1200, however, Ottokar abandoned his pact with Philip and declared for the Welf faction. Both Otto and Pope Innocent III subsequently accepted Ottokar as hereditary King of Bohemia. The Bohemian principality was then reborn into the Bohemian kingdom.\n\nIn 1212, Ottokar I, bearing the title \"king\" since 1198, extracted the Golden Bull of Sicily—a formal edict by the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants, whereby his duchy was formally raised to a Kingdom. The Bohemian king would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. The imperial prerogative to ratify each Bohemian ruler and to appoint the Bishop of Prague was revoked. The country then reached its greatest territorial extent and is considered its Golden Age.\n\nAfter the extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty, the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were ruled by the House of Luxembourg from 1310, until the death of Emperor Sigismund in 1437. After the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Bohemia remained under the rule of the Austrian House of Habsburg from 1526 until the collapse of Austria-Hungary after the First World War.\n\nSee also\n Christianization of Bohemia\n History of the Czech lands\n Holy Roman Empire\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n\n \nHistory of Bohemia\nBohemia\nGreat Moravia\n1000s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire\n1190s disestablishments in the Holy Roman Empire\n9th-century establishments in Bohemia\n870s establishments\n1198 disestablishments in Europe\nBohemia\nStates and territories established in the 870s",

        "text":" You should always use tweezers to remove a pin or tack in your skin. Do not use your fingers, as your fingers can slip and cause the pin or tack to burrow deeper into your skin. Look for tweezers that have ends that meet exactly and are the same length.Sterilize the tweezers with rubbing alcohol to ensure they are clean. Put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rub it over the tweezers or soak the tweezers in rubbing alcohol before you use them.\nIf you do not have rubbing alcohol, then you can also immerse the tweezers in boiling water for a few minutes. Carefully retrieve the tweezers from the boiling water with a pair of metal tongs and allow them to cool before touching them with your bare hands.\nIf you do not have access to rubbing alcohol or boiling water, you can use some antibacterial soap and water to clean the tweezers.;\n, If you are wearing any clothing, remove it so the area around the pin or tack is exposed. Then, put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rub the cotton ball on the area surrounding the pin or tack.You can also use soap and water if you do not have access to rubbing alcohol. Make sure you clean the area well. You do not need to soak the area with water. Simply clean it well.\n\n, If possible, get a magnifying glass so you can examine the area up close. You should move into an area with good lighting so you can clearly see the pin or tack.Look at how deep the pin or tack is in your skin. If you can see the large end of the pin or tack just under the surface of your skin, you should be able to remove it with the tweezers.\nIf the pin or tack appears to be deeply embedded in your skin, you may need to go to your doctor for medical care. Visit your local physician or walk in clinic. If you cannot see the end of the pin or tack under your skin, it may be too deep for you to remove on your own and the medical professionals who treat you may even need to use an imaging device to find it.\n\n, Use the tweezers to grasp the end of the pin or tack, flush with the surface of your skin. Make sure you get a good grip on the pin or tack with the tweezers before you pull it out.Look at the angle of the pin or tack in your skin. It may be at a straight angle or angled to one side. You should grasp and pull the pin or tack out as the same angle as it went in.\n\n, Once you have removed the pin or tack, you should dispose of it in the garbage. Then, clean the area again with soap and water. If you have access to rubbing alcohol, you may also apply this using a cotton ball., If the pin or tack was not very deep in your skin, there should be little to no blood coming out of the wound once you remove the pin or tack. If there is blood, use a cotton ball to apply pressure on the wound until the bleeding stops.If there is a lot of blood coming out of the wound, you may want to consider seeking medical treatment. The pin or tack may have been deeper in your skin than it appeared.\nCertain conditions may also put you at a higher risk for bleeding and infection. For example, if you are taking an anticoagulation medication, then you may need to see a doctor right away if the bleeding does not stop. You may also need to see a doctor right away if you have a condition that causes low platelets, also known as thrombocytopenia, or if you are immune compromised due to chemotherapy.\n\n, Make sure you apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment onto the wound to prevent infection. You can also apply a bandage over the wound so it is protected from bacteria, especially if the wound is on your foot or your hand., If the area around the pin or tack is sore and uncomfortable, you may take over-the-counter pain medication. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label and only take the recommended amount of medication., You may not be able to remove the pin or tack because it is too deep in your skin. Rather than try to force the pin or tack to come out, you should go see a doctor.The doctor may then examine and assess the wound. They may remove the pin or tack themselves and then do an x-ray to make sure no part of the pin or tack is still stuck under your skin.The doctor may also ask you if you have had a tetanus shot in the last several years as well as where you were when you were injured and how the injury occurred.\n\n, Keep an eye on the wound and watch for any signs of infection. If the area becomes swollen, very red, warm, or releases any pus, it may be infected. Also, note how the wound feels. If it appears infected or feels painful, then you should also see a doctor to have it looked at.Depending on the severity of the infection, your doctor may recommend antibiotics or a medicated cream you can apply on the wound.\nKeep in mind that once an injury occurs the tissue is damaged and it will take time for it to heal. Generally, you should see some considerable improvement within two days to one week.\n\n",

        "text":" As her husband, you will likely have some idea of what way will be best to convey this information to your wife. You may be able to simply sit down and talk, you might have to find a way to express this more gently. In any case, you may have better results if you:\n\n\nShare how you feel. Women use conversation to discover their feelings and tell these feelings to others.By doing the same, she might be more receptive to what you are saying.\n\nYou might say to your wife, \"I love you so much, seeing you struggle with your weight has me worried. Is it OK if we talk about it?\";\n, Some wives don't need, or want, to be hit over the head with a message about their weight. If this is your wife, you might want to try indicating your concerns passively. You might do this by:\n\n\nChanging your grocery habits to healthier options.\nExchanging food-centered activities for more physically engaged alternatives.\nTelling your wife that you want to get fit for yourself, and you'd like her help., Even if you have your wife's best interests in mind, using judgmental language could potential lead your wife to internalizing those comments, feeling like she's not good enough on the inside. Some phrases you should avoid include:\n\n\n\"You've put on weight.\"\n\"Did you stick to your diet today?\"\n\"You shouldn't eat that.\"\n\"Aren't you full?\", This can result in negative patterns, like overeating and oversleeping\/lethargy. Consider the following symptoms when evaluating your wife:\n\n\n\nDepression is often indicated by:\n\nRegular feelings of sadness, anxiety, emptiness\nLack of interest and participation in pleasure activities, including sex\nExcess sleeping or disturbed, unrestful sleep\nLower than normal energy levelsStress, while usually more obvious, can also be marked by:\n\nHeadaches\nBack pain\nPoor sleep\nStomach issues\nExcess tension, The sources of depression or stress are sometimes obvious, like the loss of a loved one, a new job, or the arrival of a newborn into your life. Some causes, however, can be subtle, so you should talk with your wife about how she feels and whether or not she might be feeling the effects of either of these. If she is, you might:\n\n\nRecommend exercise, as the release of endorphins experienced during and after working out can boost her mood and fight symptoms of depression and stress.Suggest that you both try meditating, as studies have shown that this can alleviate both stress and depression.Discuss the possibility of going together, or if comfortable, of her going alone to see a therapist.\n\n, You may have dreamed of walking the Great Wall of China when you were a younger couple, or perhaps you've always wanted to go on safari, or hike the Appalachian trail! Remind your wife of these goals and dreams, and use that conversation to gently bring up your concerns about her weight.\n\n, This is especially important if you have a more active metabolism or professional life than your wife. Seeing you chow down on your favorite foods while she has to adhere to a more rigid diet can lead to resentment or poor self-image.\n\n\nIf she has bought or prepares special diet food, try to encourage her healthy behaviors by participating in her dietary plans.Have a bite to show your support!\n\n, It's only natural that people tend to load their plates with the food they like, but in many cases, this creates a nutritional imbalance that is unhealthy.Variety is important; different foods contain different vitamins and other nutrients. Try to:\n\n\nInclude all food groups: protein, grains, vegetables, fruits, and diary.Eat some healthy fats, like omega 3 fatty acids.Avoid too much salt, fat, or sugar.Skip empty calories, or calories with little nutritional content, like:\nSweets\nSweetened beverages (like energy and sports drinks)\nPizza\nIce cream\n\n\n, The colors in your food are generally an indication of phytochemicals and other nutrients important for your health.An easy way to improve you and your wife's diet is by wife eating food from a wide range of colors.\n\n, You and\/or your wife may feel like you are being oppressed as you tally up the number of calories you consume throughout the day, but calorie and portion control are vital to losing weight. In the words of Peter Drucker, consultant and author, \"What gets measured, gets managed.\"Though fad diets focus on certain kinds of food and\/or sources of nutrition, many researchers today stress how overconsumption of calories is the true culprit of weight gain.Keep an eating log on your phone or in a memo pad you can carry throughout the day. List everything you eat, look up the caloric cost of those items, and identify which foods are your caloric trouble spots.\n\n, Meal plans will do more than help your wife lose weight. A meal plan can also save you time, money, and stress, all while preventing you from indulging in more convenient, less healthy options.If you notice, through your eating log, that you are not getting enough of a certain food group, tailor your meal plan to improve this.\n\n, A dietitian has the knowledge and skills to help you come up with a balanced, healthy plan for your wife's weight loss diet. You may want to bring your eating log and any meal plans you've devised on your own. This way your dietitian can:\n\n\nOffer guidance and advice about what you've already done, what can be done better, and how you might improve down the road.\nHave a full idea of your lifestyle and preferences. On the spot, you might not know what to say if he were to ask you about your diet. Having your eating log on hand can help him advise you more efficiently.\n\n, The time you spend exercising with you wife is not only good for your health, it can also promote bonding and happiness in your relationship.Show solidarity and support for your wife by encouraging her throughout the exercise, and by taking part in her healthy choices.\n\n, Depending on the weight of your wife, it may not be feasible to hit the gym right away. She might even hate going to the gym. Instead, start with small, routine activities, like:\n\n\nGoing for a walk in the morning\nA leisure sport, like tennis\nBird watching\nShell or sea glass collecting\nDancing\n\n, Even something as simple as going to the park can help relax and restore her mind and body.You might want to take a Frisbee along, or your dog. You should also consider:\n\n\nA visit to a scenic lighthouse.\nA trip to a museum or exhibit.\nVisiting local historic sites.\n\n, Routine can give a sense of safety and pleasure to your weekly activities.Generally, it takes an average of 66 days to establish a new habit, and by planning on regular activities can help establish that habit.You and your wife might agree on doing three exercise oriented activities every weekend.\nEncourage her to increase intensity and frequency as her fitness improves.\n\n, Although not necessary to improve her fitness, a gym membership would provide many resources to her. Besides exercise equipment, many gyms also have trainers on staff. These individuals can help you develop a personalized exercise plan for her weight loss. A personal trainer can also:\n\n\nHelp her develop accountability\nMotivate her\nRealize new perspectives\nAchieve proper technique and form\n\n,\nMake healthy alternatives of your favorite restaurant recipes at home.\n\n, It will be easy for her to fall into the trap of fixating on a magic number that, when achieved, will mean she is healthy. But poundage doesn't necessarily translate to healthiness.\n\n\nIf your wife is exercising and dieting, she may shed inches and tone up but stay the same weight.\nMuscle is denser than fat, so it's possible to get significantly healthier while maintaining roughly the same weight., Instead of a decadent night out full of food and drink, the use of healthy motivators can be a game changer.Plan to celebrate certain milestones and accomplishments, like her first month of exercise, with things like:\n\n\nA couples painting class\nTickets to her favorite music\nA manicure\nA massage\n\n, Even if you do not see immediate results, tell her how proud you are of her hard work as encouragement.Ask her if there are any additional ways that you can show her your support, and try to implement her suggestions., Even if she falls short of the goal, be sure you are regularly reminding her that you're proud of her effort.In some cases, you might offer too much praise, making her feel like you're talking down to her. Don't take offense. Express that you only want to applaud her efforts and ask her how you can do that better. Try to understand that:\n\n\nShe's working hard to lose weight at your initiation.\nLosing weight can be physically and emotionally exhausting.\n\n",

He is usually counted among the Kings of Wessex.\n\nLife\nCwichelm is first mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 614: \"This year Cynegils and Cwichelm fought at Beandun, and slew two thousand and forty-six of the Welsh.\"\n\nBede records that the attempted assassination of King Edwin of Deira, circa 626, was ordered by the West Saxon King Cwichelm, and does not mention Cynegils. In 628, Cynegils and Cwichelm fought King Penda at Cirencester. The Chronicle could be expected to report a victory, but does not, so it is likely that Penda was the victor.\n\nThe last mention of Cwichelm is for 636, when the Chronicle records: \"This year King Cwichelm was baptized at Dorchester, and died the same year.\" Cynegils was also baptised at this time, by Bishop Birinus, with Oswald of Bernicia as his godfather. The final entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle concerning Cwichelm, in 648, states: \"This year Cenwalh gave his relation Cuthred three thousand hides of land by Ashdown.  Cuthred was the son of Cwichelm, Cwichelm of Cynegils.\" Cuthred may have been a sub-king under Cynegils and Cenwalh.\n\nRelationship to Cynegils\nThe relationship of Cwichelm to Cynegils, and the question of whether King Cwichelm was a son of Cynegils is disputed. In the 648 entry originally referring to Cuthred, son of Cwichelm, son of Cynegils, the use of the Latin term propinquus (relation, kinsman) rather than nepos (grandson, nephew) is perhaps surprising. Barbara Yorke accepts that there was a single Cwichelm, and that he was Cynegils' son. D.P. Kirby notes that the evidence is weak, confused, and shows signs of later changes to the record. The evidence that Cwichelm was king of the Gewisse is unassailable, but the question of his ancestry and relationship to Cynegils, if any, is much less certain.\n\nSee also\nHouse of Wessex family tree\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n \n\nWest Saxon monarchs\n636 deaths\n7th-century English monarchs\nYear of birth unknown\nConverts to Christianity from pagan religions\nHouse of Wessex",

        "text":"This year I'm a sophomore in high school I'm gonna be brutally honest sophomore year overall is hard. There a lot of test and homework, the pressure to get good grade and get into a good college is always in the back of my mind.\n\nFor example if I'm learning a new lesson in math class I sometimes find myself always getting confused. But I feel like we all have been there when learning something new. But if we had something to tell teachers that we are confused I think it could help kids understand what were learning better.  It's called Facial Action Coding System and I think it could be really useful in a classroom.\n\nI think by being able to read a student's emotional expression is a excellent idea.\n \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D' Alto is a hard arguement about if we should have a Facial Action Coding System in a classroom or not. But Dr. Huang says \"A classroonm computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Some kids get home from school, they have sports or maybe a job that they have to work to until midnight. In the morning they might become tired and fall alsleep learning something new. So with the Facial Action Coding System we could find out which students need a little bit extra help  Another quote is \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your sceen, a similar ad might follow.\" \"But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" We could use this same idea in a classroom the computer will know which kids look a little confused and will know which kids aren't understand the lesson. Some kids are shy and don't wanna speak up and say if they don't get it what there learning, now with this technology. We will now know the student that don't understand so they can do better in school.  By identifying human emotions we could also help the kids that are very stressed out and might just need to take a little break  It says \"They even indicate the different between a genuine smile and a forced one.\" If some is upset in a classroom this technology should pick up right away if a person isn't feeling good or even sad. It could help teacher know what potentially could be wrong with one of her students  Another way we could find out what's on a student's mind is \"to an expert, faces don't lie; there muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This could as well tell a teacher if a student is telling the truth or not. By having this system we could find out what's wrong with a student or even find out if there lying.\n I feel that if we had Facial Action Coding Systems in a classroom the student will understand what there learning better and probably get a better grade in the class overall . We know how important it is to do good in school, we heard it since day one. I want nothing more to graduate from college and go to the college of my dreams. Maybe with this new Coding System can help me get a better grade in the class and help me get the help I need. So I could potentially get into the college I want to get into. ",

        "text":" Even if the speech you’ve been asked to give is only a minute long, preparing and organizing your thoughts beforehand can make the difference between a tepid response and a warm one. ‘’Always’’ devote some time to developing your speech before you step up to the podium. Don’t rely on your natural charisma or your ability to think on your feet — once you’re staring out at the dozens or hundreds of expectant faces in the audience, you may find that your ability to be charming and profound come less naturally to you than you thought.\n\n, Like talented authors, good speechwriters know to adjust the content of their speech to fit the needs of their audience. Serious or formal occasions with important guests will require speeches that are similarly formal, while more light-hearted affairs may call for a less serious tone. When in doubt, err on the side of formality — it’s usually less embarrassing to deliver a formal speech at a casual event than vice versa.\n\n\nAs a general rule, the smaller your audience and the more intimately you know its members, the more casual your speech may be.\n\n, Unless you're sure that everyone in the audience will be perfectly aware of your importance, you'll probably want to start your speech with a few brief words about yourself just to give the audience an idea of who you are. This will probably involve briefly listing your position, some important work you've done, and your connection to the honor or award that you're receiving. Keep these remarks short and humble — your goal isn't to build yourself up or brag, but to introduce yourself to people who are unfamiliar with you. Additionally, you may want to be prepared to skip some of your opening remarks if the person who welcomes you to the podium gives you a lengthy introduction.\n\n\nFor instance, if you're accepting an \"Employee of the Year\" award at the tech firm you work for, assuming that your audience contains people who don't know you, you may want to begin with an introduction along these lines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hello. Thank you for honoring me this evening. As you've just heard, my name is Jane Smith. I joined this company in 2009, and since then, I've worked with the marketing, content, and analytics departments in varying capacities. Earlier this year, I had the honor of collaborating with my boss, John Q. Public, on a new data processing system, which is why we're here today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, All speeches should have some sort of purpose or \"point\" — otherwise, why would anyone bother listening? After you've introduced yourself, don't waste time moving to the \"meat\" of your speech. Try to tell the audience why they should listen and what you hope for them to take away from your speech fairly early on to give them a sense of direction and prepare them for what you have to say.\n\n\nSince you’re presumably accepting some sort of award or honor, a good theme to center your speech around is ‘’gratitude’’. Centering at least part of your speech around thanking those who helped you get to where you are makes you appear humble and deserving of the praise you’re receiving, rather than haughty or conceited. In addition to this, you may also want to consider offering advice to your audience or giving some sort of call to action. Whatever you choose, be sure to briefly make your speech's purpose clear in the beginning. For instance, you might want to say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm here today to offer my sincerest gratitude to the dozens of people without whom this experience wouldn't have been possible. I'd also like to briefly discuss the role that the idea of \"going the extra mile\" has played in setting this company apart from the others in the tech field.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, As you offer your thanks and advice to the audience, try to explain just how important the honor you're receiving is to you. For instance, you may want to mention that the honor is important to you because it's a sign you've earned the respect of the people who are most important in your life. Doing this proves your sincerity and gives the audience an appreciation of the honor being bestowed. It's not just a trophy or a plaque — it has a symbolic importance that goes beyond this.\n\n\nOne good trick is to call attention to the fact that the honor you’re receiving, while important to you, is less meaningful than the continued honor of simply getting to do what you love. This sort of acknowledgement makes you look humble, passionate, and supremely deserving of your honor. For instance, if you’re receiving a lifetime achievement award for your decades of work as a teacher, you might want to say something like:\n\n\n\n\n\n“As much as I appreciate this award and as grateful as I am for it, the greatest reward I’ve ever been given is the simple opportunity to help generations of kids learn how to think critically about the world around them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The ending of a speech is one of the hardest parts to perfect, but it's also one of the most important because it's the part everyone will have the easiest time remembering. Try to give your ending a serious emotional wallop or a rousing call to action — you're looking to go out with a bang, not a whimper. Try to use words and imagery that have strong emotional resonance. For your last sentence, try to end with a witty observation or a powerful statement of truth.\n\n\nFor instance, in the teacher example above, we might end like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As we leave here today, I'd like to ask the members of the audience to take a moment to think about the importance of educating the children of this generation. Tomorrow's problems demand bright, hard-working individuals to solve them, and the only way we can create these individuals is by acting as a community to support our schools, our teachers, and the countless people that they depend on for their continued strength.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This is an absolute must for acceptance speeches — somewhere in your speech, you need to thank the people who helped you succeed, even if, in your opinion, their help wasn't that essential. Forgetting to graciously thank the people who contributed to your achievement can potentially lead to hurt feelings and embarrassment for you. This is easily avoided by devoting some of your speech to personally thanking as many people who worked with you or supported you as possible (preferably near the beginning or end of your speech so that this is well remembered).\n\n\nWhen you're thanking people, it's a wise idea to end with something along the lines of, \"and finally, I'd like to thank everyone else who supported me during my work — there are too many people to list, but I want to thank you all personally.\" This covers your bases in case you forget anyone who played a minor role in your success.\n\n, If you're having a hard time penning your speech, consider turning to famous acceptance speeches for ideas on how (and how not) to proceed. Modern history is full of examples of great (and terrible) acceptance speeches that can be used as inspiration. Just a few notable examples are listed below:\n\n\nAs a positive example, consider Jimmy Valvano's phenomenal acceptance speech at the 1993 ESPY awards. Just eight weeks before his premature death from cancer, the famed college basketball coach delivered an immensely moving speech to an ecstatic standing ovation from the crowd.As an example of what not to do, consider Hilary Swank's Oscar acceptance speech for \"Boys Don't Cry\" in 2000. Swank accepted her award gratefully, doling out thanks to all of her supporters, with the major exception of her husband, whom the cameras famously caught crying tears of joy during Swank's speech.As an oddball example, consider Joe Pesci’s Oscar acceptance speech. After taking the podium at the 1991 Oscars for his work in \"Goodfellas,\" Pesci said simply, \"It's my privilege. Thank you.\"Pesci was both praised and lampooned for his five word speech.\n\n, Unlike written text, oral speech can't be \"re-read\" — once you say something, it's been said, and your speech continues whether your audience understood it or not. To minimize the chance for misunderstanding and keep your audience's attention throughout your speech, keep your words simple. Use clear, concrete language. Don't make your sentences (or the entire speech) any longer than it needs to be to communicate the points you're trying to get across. People are much more likely to have a favorable impression of a short, simple, powerful speech than they are of a long-winded, complicated, and meandering one.\n\n, For long speeches, it may be impractical or even impossible to have every word of your speech memorized. However, even in these cases where having an outline or a copy of the speech handy is a virtual necessity, you'll still want to have all of the main points you intend to address in your speech ready in your head before you begin speaking. Be sure to know what the main points of your speech are, what order they come in, and any key transitions or examples you use.\n\n\nKnowing the outline of your speech ahead of time is useful for multiple reasons. For instance, not only will this prevent certain technical snafus (for instance, a breeze carrying your speech away) from derailing your speech, but it can also help you deliver your speech more confidently. After all, if you know basically what you need to say ahead of time, what need is there to worry?\n\n, Mediocre speeches are a dime a dozen. Make your speech memorable by making it something only you could deliver. Craft your speech into a product of your own personality — give your audience opportunities not just to remember the speech itself, but also the person giving it. One easy way to do this is to include brief, memorable personal anecdotes in your speech that are pertinent to the honor you're receiving or the themes you're addressing in your speech. Include these as you please, but don't forget to exercise restraint — remember, short and simple speeches are blessings to most people in the audience.\n\n, Humor has a place in some acceptance speeches. A witty remark is a great way to break the ice at the beginning of a speech and a few jokes peppered throughout can help keep the audience's attention. However, keep the amount (and type) of humor you use under control. Don't rely too excessively on constant joking and don't include lewd, offensive, or controversial jokes. Unless you're a professional entertainer, your audience probably expects a pleasant, dignified speech, rather than a raunchy, joke-filled tirade, so give it what it wants.\n\n\nAlso, don’t forget that there may be people in the audience who were in the running for the honor you ended up receiving. Because of this, you won’t want to demean the organization that’s honoring you or jokingly imply that you were a bad choice. Maintain respect for yourself, the organization honoring you, and the audience as you accept your award.\n\n, Like writing, singing, or acting, speech-giving is an art form. The more you do it, the better you become. Though it's impossible to replicate the experience of standing in front of your audience and giving your speech for real before you actually have to do it, practicing alone or in front of a smaller audience can help you memorize the main points of your speech and get enough experience delivering it that it becomes familiar to you. In addition, practice can also help you pin down problems ahead of time. For instance, if there's part of your speech that your test audience doesn't react as well to as you thought it would, you may take this as a sign that it should be removed or edited before the actual speech.\n\n\nAs you practice, time yourself. You may be surprised how much longer (or shorter) your speech is than you thought it would be. If you have a hard time limit for your speech, use the results of your timed practice to edit your speech as necessary.\n\n, If you're using a written copy of your speech or an outline to keep you on-track, be sure to edit this aid both for its factual accuracy and for proper conventions of grammar, spelling, and sentence flow. One of the absolute most-embarrassing places you can discover an error in your speech is on the podium while you're delivering it, so avoid this awkward situation by thoroughly proofreading your first draft at least once or twice before your speech.\n\n, When you're waiting for your turn to speak at the podium, calm, quiet relaxation will probably be the last thing on your mind. However, knowing how to calm your nerves ahead of time can make an otherwise stressful speech a relative breeze. Below are just a few patented techniques to help minimize problems caused by a case of the jitters during your speech:Rapid heartbeat: Breathe deeply and slowly. Concentrate on someone in the room you're comfortable around, like a friend or family member. Start delivering the words of your speech — you'll naturally relax once you start talking.\nRacing, panicked thoughts: Take deep breaths. Look out into the audience and see the humor in their blank, expressionless faces. Alternatively, imagine that the members of the audience are somehow unimportant or laughable (e.g., that they're all in their underwear, etc.)\nDry mouth: Bring a bottle of water with you onstage to drink as you need it. Consider also chewing gum before (but not during) your speech. Mimicking the process of eating can have a calming effect on the emotions. In addition, it can stimulate saliva production, preventing a dry mouth.\nTrembling: Breathe deeply and slowly. If necessary, try slowly tensing and releasing the muscles in the trembling body part to work out the excess energy from your adrenaline high.\nAbove all, relax. You've prepared, so you have no reason to worry about how the speech will turn out. Worrying will only make it harder to deliver the great speech that you're perfectly capable of giving.\n\n, Even people who otherwise have no tics or neuroses sometimes develop strange repetitive behaviors when put under pressure in public. The best cure for nearly any sort of tic is to relax with the techniques listed above. However, in addition, making a mental list of common speech-giving tics ahead of time can allow you to catch them if you notice them appear while you're delivering your speech. Below are just a few of the most common problems you'll probably want to avoid:\n\n\nHurrying or rushing through your speech.\nMumbling\nFidgeting or messing with something in your hands\nSwaying from side to side.\nCoughing\/sniffling excessively\n\n, As noted above, one of the most common problems that inexperienced speakers have is that they can tend to rush or mumble through their speech unintentionally. The way you speak when you're giving a speech shouldn't be the same way you talk to people you're close to in a casual setting — you want to speak slower, more clearly, and somewhat louder than you normally would. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to dwell on every word and take long pauses between your sentences, just that you should make an effort to ensure that even the hard-of-hearing in the audience can understand you.\n\n, When you give an acceptance speech, you're addressing the audience, so you'll want to look at the audience for most of your speech just as you'd look at the person you're addressing if you were talking to only one person. It's OK to give the notes or the outline you have with you a quick look to keep your speech on-track. Try to limit this to short glances no longer than a few seconds or so long. The rest of the time, hold your head high and speak directly to the audience in front of you.\n\n\nIf you can remember to do so, try to gradually move your gaze from side to side as you look at your audience. Sweeping your eyes back and forth gives the members of the audience the impression that you're addressing them all individually. If this \"sweeping\" motion is tricky for you, try randomly picking individuals in the audience to look at for a few seconds at a time as you talk.\n\n, To someone who's nervous about giving a speech, the audience can seem like one big, scary, imposing entity that must be confronted and appeased. In fact, the audience is anything but this — it's actually made up of many different individuals, all of which have their own internal motives and preoccupations (just like you!) Some of the people in the audience may be thinking about their own problems or simply daydreaming while you give your speech. Others may be practically (or literally) asleep. Some may not even be intelligent enough to understand your speech! On the other hand, some may find your speech interesting or important. Few, however, are likely to find it as important as you do, so don't be scared by your audience! Thinking of your audience as a collection of real, imperfect people, rather than as a faceless, monolithic crowd is a sure-fire way to make it easier to relax.\n\n",

Polish units crossed the border, invading Belarus. They attacked the township of Bereza and crossed the Neman River, taking Pinsk and reaching the outskirts of Lida.\n\nThe first skirmish of Bereza is considered to be the initial engagement of the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921 by some historians.\n\nHistory\nAfter German and Polish representatives signed an evacuation agreement on 5 February 1919, the ten battalions of the newly formed Polish Army were to pass through German Oberkommando-Ostfront (Ober-Ost) lines at Wolkowysk to reach the Bolshevik front, where on 12 January 1919, the Soviet Supreme Command ordered a \"reconnaissance in depth\", codenamed Target Vistula. \n\nIn February 1919, both Soviet Russia and newly-reborn Poland were in their infancy, and both only months old. On 13 February 1919, at 7 in the morning, 57 Polish soldiers and 5 officers, led by Capt. Mienicki of the Polish Wilno Detachment, made a sortie into the township of Biaroza (), a small city to the east of Brzesc capturing 80 soldiers of the Red Army.\n\nThe second Battle of Bereza Kartuska\nOne year later, between 21 and 26 July 1920, soldiers of the Polish 14th Infantry Division under General Daniel Konarzewski once again clashed with the Red Army in Bereza Kartuska, soon after the Battle of Warsaw (1920). Poles had retreated from Baranowicze, abandoning German Imperial Army fortifications constructed there during World War I, and took defensive positions along the Jasiołda River. After three days of heavy fighting, the 14th I.D. once again was forced to retreat towards Kobryn, after burning the bridges on the Jasiołda. The town of Bereza Kartuska was retaken by the Polish Army and, at the end of the Polish–Soviet War, ceded to Poland in the Peace of Riga signed by Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus). The peace treaty remained in force until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.\n\nReferences \n\nBereza Kartuska\n1919 in Poland\nBereza Kartuska\n1919 in Belarus\nMilitary history of Belarus\nByaroza\nFebruary 1919 events\nWestern Belorussia (1918–1939)\nBattles in 1919",

        "text":"The BBC Studios Natural History Unit (NHU) is a department of BBC Studios that produces television, radio and online content with a natural history or wildlife theme. It is best known for its highly regarded nature documentaries, including The Blue Planet and Planet Earth, and has a long association with David Attenborough's authored documentaries, starting with 1979's Life on Earth.\n\nThe Natural History Unit is a specialist department within BBC Studios Productions. Each year it produces around 100 hours of television and 50 hours of radio programmes, making it the largest wildlife documentary production house in the world. The BBC commissions programmes from the Unit for broadcast on five terrestrial television channels (BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies) and BBC Radio 4. It also makes programmes for other broadcasters and services including Apple TV+, Warner Bros. Discovery, National Geographic Global Networks and NBC Universal. Content is marketed internationally under the BBC Earth brand. Original content is also broadcast on the Earth Unplugged YouTube channel.\n\nThe Unit has been based in Broadcasting House, Bristol since its formation in 1957, and has been headed by Julian Hector since 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst steps in natural history broadcasting\n\nThe BBC natural history unit's links to Bristol date back to the 1940s, when Desmond Hawkins, then a young producer, joined the West Region staff. His personal interest in the subject led to a radio series called The Naturalist, which began on the Home Service in 1946 and proved an immediate success, later augmented by Out of Doors and Birds in Britain.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes, West Region and was keen to translate his success to the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service, but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and the two men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nUntil such formalities were completed, natural history programmes were the responsibility of the Features office of the West Region. One of the first programmes was an outside broadcast from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust's centre at Slimbridge in 1953, the first TV collaboration between the BBC and Peter Scott. Occasional programmes continued the following year, but it was not until 1955 that the BBC began a regular studio-based series, Look, presented by Scott.\n\nOne of the early problems for the Unit was the difficulty in sourcing film stock. At the time, the only wildlife cameramen were amateurs, and the footage wasn't always good enough for broadcast. The embryo unit's first film camera, a clockwork Bolex, was bought from a Bristol camera shop with petty cash by Desmond's assistant, Tony Soper. Some of Scott's own expedition films were used for early episodes of Look. One particularly outstanding film from 1955, shot by Heinz Sielmann, showed woodpeckers inside a nest hole.\n\nUnit formation\n\nBy 1957, with Look firmly established and Gillard and Hawkins lobbying hard, the BBC management in London approved the official formation of a Natural History Unit. Gillard was on the search for a senior producer to head the new Unit, and asked David Attenborough to take on the role. Attenborough had good credentials (he was a trained zoologist) but declined, having recently settled in London with his young family. Instead, he was placed in charge of the newly formed Travel and Exploration Unit, striking a deal which would allow him to continue to film his popular Zoo Quest (1954–1963) series alongside natural history output from the fledgling Bristol unit. The Travel and Exploration Unit in London also introduced viewers to more exotic wildlife, and made household names of the first natural history presenters. Armand and Michaela Denis filmed East African wildlife for their On Safari programmes, whilst another pioneering husband-and-wife team, Hans and Lotte Hass, created some of the first underwater films.\n\nNicholas Crocker, a senior producer with West Region, became the Unit's first Head in September 1957. Founder members included Tony Soper (producer) and Christopher Parsons (assistant film editor), both of whom would go on to play a major part in the Unit's development.\n\nAlthough much of the Unit's early output concentrated on British and European wildlife, one of its first productions to be broadcast was Faraway Look featuring Peter Scott in Australia. The early programmes were limited by the available technology, but it was also a time of great experimentation in style and content, bringing the Unit notable success. Animal Magic (1962–1983), presented by Johnny Morris and Tony Soper, was a successful format for young audiences which ran for over 20 years. The Unit also collaborated with Gerald Durrell on several films of his animal-collecting expeditions, beginning with the studio-based series To Bafut for Beef (April 1958), using African footage shot by Durrell.\n\nColour television arrives\nIn the early 1960s, natural history filmmaking was being held back by the limitations of the available technology, particularly the restrictions of shooting often fast-moving subjects in poor light and spectacularly colourful subjects in black and white. The second of these problems was about to be resolved.\n\nAround the same time, the technology to broadcast and receive colour television was being developed, and the BBC made funds available to begin filming in colour to allow filmmakers to experiment with the latest equipment in preparation for the switchover. The Major (1963), produced by Parsons and filmed largely by New Forest cameraman Eric Ashby, told the story of an ancient English oak and was the Unit's first colour production. This was one of six films made for the BBC by part-time film-makers Ron Peggs and Leslie Jackman. Leslie filmed the insect sequences at his home in Paignton using specimens collected by John Burton.\n\nColour transmission finally arrived in 1967 on BBC 2 under the stewardship of David Attenborough, who had retired from programme-making to move into BBC administration. The first natural history film to be shown in colour was Ron Eastman's The Private Life of the Kingfisher (1968), written and produced by Jeffery Boswall.\n\nAttenborough, by then controller of BBC 2, wanted to make a strong statement on BBC's second channel of the boundless possibilities that colour television offered, and recognised that natural history was the obvious subject matter to choose. He commissioned a series called The World About Us (1969–1982) that would broadcast in a 50-minute Sunday evening slot. Because of the challenge of producing enough colour material, the commission was shared between the NHU and London's Travel and Exploration Unit. The extended opportunities offered by the 50-minute format and improvements in film technology and expertise finally allowed the NHU to begin showcasing its talent.\n\nBirth of the 'personal view' series\nOne of Attenborough's main achievements as Controller of BBC 2 was to commission Civilisation (1969), a major series presented by the respected art historian Kenneth Clark. It was a resounding success with critics and the public, pioneering the 'personal view' form of documentary films for television. Parsons, by then an experienced producer with the NHU, recognised the potential for a similar treatment with natural history as the subject and approached Attenborough in 1970 with the idea. Attenborough was receptive, even to the idea that he should present the series, but both men realised at that time that it was beyond the scope of the Unit's capabilities.\n\nWhen Attenborough resigned from his administrative duties to return to programme making at the start of 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that if it had not been for computerised airline schedules, the series would have probably been impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, Life on Earth drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide.\n\nBuilding on success\n\nThe Natural History Unit made its name with Life on Earth, and was rewarded by being awarded departmental status by BBC management in December 1979. Christopher Parsons, by then its most experienced producer, became the first official Head of the Unit. It celebrated its silver jubilee in 1982 with the miniseries Flight of the Condor, and sealed its reputation as one of the foremost production companies for popular natural history films in the following decades. A succession of series have followed the format established by Life on Earth, often presented or narrated by Attenborough, and transmitted on the BBC's main channel. The Blue Planet (2001) and Planet Earth (2006) typify these signature programmes, characterised by high production values, specially-commissioned musical scores and often ground-breaking footage of wildlife from around the globe.\n\nThe NHU has also diversified into other programme formats. Its Diary series have featured African big cats, elephants, orang-utans and bears in a nightly wildlife soap opera. Among of the longest-running programmes has been Wildlife on One (1977–2005) which was broadcast in a regular evening slot.\n\nThe Continents strand on BBC Two has featured series on all the world's major land areas over the past eighteen years, including Spirits of the Jaguar (1996), Land of the Tiger (1997), Andes to Amazon (2000) and Wild Down Under (2003). Also on BBC Two, the annual Springwatch (since 2005) and Autumnwatch (since 2006) series have brought live pictures of British wildlife into millions of homes.\n\n50 years of wildlife film making\nIn 2007, the Unit celebrated its 50th anniversary and was rewarded with a special award at the International Broadcasting Convention in recognition of its unique contribution to wildlife film and documentary making.\n\nOn television, the anniversary was marked with the broadcast of Saving Planet Earth, a conservation-themed series which helped to raise over £1.5 million for the BBC Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn October 2007, the BBC announced that the NHU would suffer cuts of a third in both staff numbers and its £37 million annual budget, as a result of the Government's decision to impose a lower than inflation increase in the television licence fee. The cutbacks were widely condemned within the media industry and by programme-makers, including David Attenborough.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Keith Scholey, Factual Controller of BBC Vision, promised that the BBC would \"continue to make and show the ambitious, large-scale, truly memorable series that audiences associate with BBC natural history output\". Titles affected by the cuts include the BBC Two Wild strand.\n\nProductions already underway were not affected by the cuts, so the following year came Wild China, Pacific Abyss, Lost Land of the Jaguar and Big Cat Live, as well as the Unit's most ambitious radio event to date, World on the Move. Natural World also received a three-year commission from BBC Two on its 25th anniversary.\n\nModern Era\n\nPost 2010, a greater emphasis was placed on climate change, which several special programmes broadcast focusing on the issue. More broadly, series looked at the negative effects of climate change and habitat destruction within series that did not focus solely on the topic.\n\nIn 2016, BBC's non-news content production, including natural history, was separated into a commercial subsidiary BBC Studios. NHU head Wendy Darke departed and was succeeded by Julian Hector.\n\nFilmography \n\nSince its inception in the 1950s, the Natural History Unit has produced a wealth of material for television, radio, and more recently, cinema. Being the first and the largest production unit devoted to natural history programme making, it maintains an extensive archive of images and sound recordings as well as film materials. The filmography article presents a chronological summary of the Unit's major television and film productions.\n\nIn production \nAs well as returning series such as Natural World and Springwatch and natural history content for BBC One's The One Show, the Unit has television series currently in production:\n\n Planet Earth III  (8 x 60min, transmission on BBC One in 2023)\n\nAwards and recognition \nThe Natural History Unit as a whole was awarded the Gold Medal at the 2001 Royal Television Society awards for its \"outstanding contribution over the past 44 years to broadcasting about the natural world\". It was praised for being \"a national resource for people's understanding and love of wildlife on our planet, and a symbol of both quality and talent in public service broadcasting\".\n\nNHU filmmakers are regularly nominated and rewarded at film festivals such as Wildscreen, the Missoula International Wildlife Film Festival and the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival and their output has been recognised by the wider broadcasting industry too, winning four Emmys, eleven BAFTAs, and the Prix Italia on three occasions. \n\nRecognition has also come in the form of high audience viewing figures and audience approval ratings, particularly for 'blue-chip' series such as Planet Earth.

        "text":"  Small satellite constellations provide daily global coverage of the earth's\nlandmass, but image enrichment relies on automating key tasks like change\ndetection or feature searches. For example, to extract text annotations from\nraw pixels requires two dependent machine learning models, one to analyze the\noverhead image and the other to generate a descriptive caption. We evaluate\nseven models on the previously largest benchmark for satellite image captions.\nWe extend the labeled image samples five-fold, then augment, correct and prune\nthe vocabulary to approach a rough min-max (minimum word, maximum description).\nThis outcome compares favorably to previous work with large pre-trained image\nmodels but offers a hundred-fold reduction in model size without sacrificing\noverall accuracy (when measured with log entropy loss). These smaller models\nprovide new deployment opportunities, particularly when pushed to edge\nprocessors, on-board satellites, or distributed ground stations. To quantify a\ncaption's descriptiveness, we introduce a novel multi-class confusion or error\nmatrix to score both human-labeled test data and never-labeled images that\ninclude bounding box detection but lack full sentence captions. This work\nsuggests future captioning strategies, particularly ones that can enrich the\nclass coverage beyond land use applications and that lessen color-centered and\nadjacency adjectives (\"green\", \"near\", \"between\", etc.). Many modern language\ntransformers present novel and exploitable models with world knowledge gleaned\nfrom training from their vast online corpus. One interesting, but easy example\nmight learn the word association between wind and waves, thus enriching a beach\nscene with more than just color descriptions that otherwise might be accessed\nfrom raw pixels without text annotation.\n",

        "text":" If you've just finished writing your manuscript, you're probably feeling a well-deserved sense of accomplishment. When you're attached to your work immediately after completing the manuscript, it can be very difficult to distance yourself from your work enough to make the necessary cuts and revisions. Rather than trying to jump right into the editing phase after completion, it's best to set your work aside for a while so you can approach it with a fresh set of eyes.A fresh read allows you to effectively view the manuscript as if you were reading someone else's work, which can make it easier to distance yourself from your own words.\nIf at all possible, give yourself at least a week without reading or working on your manuscript in any way. If you can give yourself a few weeks it may be even better.;\n, When you're ready to sit down and begin editing, it may be helpful for you to have a hard copy printed out. Seeing your words on the computer may force you to see the work as you did while you were writing it - in other words, things that made sense to you in your head may read differently when viewed as a final product.Some writers find that reading words on a printed page makes it easier to spot mistakes, weak spots, and poorly-written passages.\n\n, Before you actually get down to editing the manuscript, you may find it helpful to read through it once as though you were a reader picking up a printed book. Don't make any changes to the manuscript while you're reading through it - you're still in the preparation stage. Simply make notes in the margins when you find a section that is confusing or poorly written so that you know where to focus your attention when you return to the manuscript.Aim to simply get an overall impression of the work as a whole.\nThink of yourself as an outside reader. Try to get through the entire manuscript in no more than three or four readings so that you can take in the piece as a complete work.\nWere there any parts of the manuscript that feel incomplete or confusing? Make note of those sections, but don't worry about revising them yet.\nWhat were the strong\/compelling\/interesting parts of the manuscript? Mark those so you know what you're most reluctant to cut.\n\n, Reading aloud can help you hear the words instead of simply seeing them. Many people find that hearing words spoken out loud makes it easier to catch errors. Reading aloud also makes you slow down, which could be another reason that it is easier to catch errors.\n\n, Go back through the manuscript with a fine-toothed comb. Is there anything about the actual content that is not working? For fiction, are there any plot holes or places where the narrative falls apart? For creative nonfiction (memoir, essay collection, reportage), are there any gaps in your work where perhaps something that made sense to you may not make sense to an outside reader? For a scholarly manuscript, does the research clearly support your conclusions?Are there any conclusions your writing jumps to that may not make sense to a reader?\nDoes everything in the manuscript make sense? Is everything consistent from start to finish? If you have a thesis or central argument, is it complete and sufficiently supported?\nAre your characters realistic and believable? Are they interesting and complex, or do they fall flat and two-dimensional?For nonfiction works, are you presenting each individual fairly and honestly?\nAre there enough sensory details in the manuscript? Does the narrative come to life and draw you in?\nMake revisions as necessary to satisfy these and any other points of concern within the manuscript.\n\n, If you're writing a scholarly submission, you'll need a proper introduction and conclusion. If the manuscript is a creative work, it will need a compelling beginning and a strong ending. And on a page-by-page level, the entirety of the manuscript should be arranged with a clear and logical progression that leads the reader naturally from the beginning to the end.Look for transitions that guide the reader from one paragraph to the next. If your transitions are weak or lacking altogether, compose a sentence or two that will serve as a transition to the next paragraph.\nWhen you were reading through your manuscript, did you find yourself losing interest at any point in the middle of the work? If so, perhaps you need to restructure the body of the manuscript. You may have loaded all the strong sections at the beginning and ending and forgotten to focus on the body of the piece. Rewrite these sections as needed.\n\n, Once you've taken care of the larger issues like plot and structure, you'll need to take a close look at the language that you use in each line. Look for consistency in your line work and strong, well-polished sentences.Make sure that the point of view and tense stay consistent. Don't suddenly jump from one person's perspective to another, or from past tense to present or future tense.\nAre there any awkward sentences that are confusing, clunky, or just poorly written? What about run-on sentences? Never-ending paragraphs? Remember that readers tend to prefer short, action-packed paragraphs instead of long-winded, drawn-out ones.\nLook for and replace\/remove \"crutch words\" - those words and phrases you tend to fall back on out of comfort or over-reliance. Instead, try rephrasing those sentences with fresh, original prose or cutting these parts out altogether.Find any sentences that are unnecessary (\"filler\" lines) and cut them out. No matter how much you may like the way you composed a line, if it's not essential and doesn't contribute to the plot or to any character's development it's a waste of space.\n\n, No matter how thoroughly you edit your manuscript, there may inevitably be some issues that you are blind to. That's where having an outside reader can come in handy. If you want a professional editor, you can search for editing services online. You can also ask someone you know and trust to review your work, but it should be someone who is capable of giving you objective feedback. It's best to avoid asking parents or significant others for feedback, as they may have a hard time looking past your relationship to find issues that need to be improved.Ask your reader\/editor whether:\n\n\nyour manuscript makes sense\nyour ideas are clear and well-organized\nthe transitions between ideas, sentences, and paragraphs are all smooth and well-executed\nyour writing style is appealing and easy to engage with\nthere are any grammatical, syntactical, or formatting issues, If you haven't kept your computer's spellcheck function on during the writing process, turn it on now. Run a spellcheck for the entire document and look for any misspellings, improper use of capital\/lowercase letters, and grammatical errors. Correcting these mistakes will help make your manuscript look more professional and polished, and could be the difference between a publisher's approval and rejection., Many people learned to type by putting two spaces after each period. Today, however, most editors and publishers (with relatively few exceptions) only use a single space. Having two spaces after each punctuation mark forces the editor to comb over your entire manuscript and take out the unnecessary spaces. You can save your editor a lot of time and effort (and thereby make your manuscript more appealing) by using the conventional method of only one single space after punctuation marks.If you need to remove extra spaces throughout your manuscript and you're using Microsoft Word, you can use the \"find and replace\" function. Simply navigate to \"Edit,\" hover your mouse over \"Find,\" and click \"Replace.\" In the \"Find what\" section, type the space bar twice, and in the \"Replace\" section, type the space bar once. Then click \"Replace All.\", If you're submitting to a publisher, you should have a decent idea of how that publisher wants your manuscript to be formatted. If the publisher hasn't directly communicated her desired formatting guidelines, check the publisher's website. Most publishing houses include guidelines on their website that dictate the font size and style, spacing between lines (usually either single-spaced or double-spaced), indentations, margins, page breaks, and page numbers.The standard font type is Times New Roman with a 12-point font.\nMany publishers want page numbers, but not all do. For those that do, they may request that the numbers be printed in the top right, bottom right, or bottom center of the page.\nIf you're submitting a scholarly manuscript, be sure that your citations are formatted the way the publisher wants them., Now that you've made changes to the sentences, structure, and plot of your manuscript, taken out unnecessary portions, and reformatted it as necessary, read through the manuscript again. You'll certainly notice a lot of improvement, but try not to get caught up in how much better the manuscript is. Instead, look for any places that may need further revisions, and focus on polishing those sections as well.\n\n, If you feel comfortable sharing your work with someone else (a trusted friend or family member, for example), do so. Just as you needed to have fresh eyes before you could begin revision, the freshest eyes belong to an outside, unbiased reader. There may still be parts of the manuscript that make sense to you in your head, but to an outsider would be confusing, unclear, or simply unlikeable.Let your reader know that you want an honest, thorough assessment of the manuscript. Tell your friends to save their praise for when the manuscript is published, and let them know that you want useful, thoughtful feedback on what needs improvement.\nIf you feel that the feedback you get is valid, make any necessary changes to the manuscript. Remember that it's normal for most manuscripts to go through numerous extensive revisions before being published.\nTreat your friends to a nice meal or a bottle of their favorite liquor (assuming you're both old enough to legally drink) to show your appreciation.\n\n, When you feel that your manuscript is well polished and complete, it's time to try and publish it. If you have an editor or agent, submit your work to that person. If you're sending it to a publisher, confirm that that publisher is currently accepting new manuscripts. Be sure to include a letter of thanks to show your appreciation for the editor\/agent\/publisher's time and interest, and show thanks to anyone else who's helped get your manuscript to the publication stage.\n\n",

Fish oil is the richest source of fat vital to brain development in unborn babies and infants, and it helps maintain the brain throughout life.Eat about 14 ounces of fish a week or three servings that are about the size of your fist. Fish oil is available in food supplements. You can find it fortified with DHA, as well. It is also sold as Omega 3 Oil in its own separate supplements. This is especially important for continued brain and cardiovascular health;\n, Dark, leafy greens such as kale and spinach are essential for a healthy mind and body. These contain high levels of vitamin E and folate.Vitamin E likely helps protect your brain's neurons,while the relationship between folate and brain health isn't as clear. It's likely that it helps keep down levels of homocysteine in the brain, as this amino acid may lead to nerve cell death if the levels are too high.You can also try avocado for a good source of vitamin E, as well as sunflower seeds., Blueberries have been shown to help with short term memory loss in some studies, so eat them a few times a week.Other berries have brain-boosting benefits, too, such as strawberries and acai berries., Tomatoes, which can contain high levels of lycopene, help protect against free radical cell damage, which in turn, may help protect against dementia., Nuts contain alpha linolenic acid (ALA), and they have anti-inflammatory properties. These qualities help increase blood flow, which makes your brain happy with more oxygen.They are also high in vitamin E., Ginger, along with other foods such as berries, soy products, and teas, help protect your glial cells. These cells likely remove toxins from the brain, protecting you from diseases such as Alzheimer's.Try ginger tea, or add ginger to a stir fry for extra spice.\n\n, The theanine(an amino acid) in green tea may help to improve memory and attention span.Drink one to three cups of green tea daily., Whole grains are a part of an overall healthy diet that will improve your general health. The healthier your body is, the healthier your brain is. They can also help lower your risk for high blood pressure, which keeps your brain healthier.If you're over age 9, you should be getting at least 3 to 5 servings of whole grains per day, up to 6 or 7 servings as an adult. To get your servings in, try oatmeal, whole wheat bread, quinoa, brown rice, or whole wheat pasta., Eating small meals throughout the day, as opposed to one large meal, can help with brain health. It keeps your blood sugar level throughout the day, providing the energy your brain needs. Try four to six meals instead of three to five.",

Every packet that comes in has a source and destination  Media Access Control (MAC) Address. The switch keeps an internal table of what MAC addresses it has seen communicating over which of its physical ports. When it receives a message destined for a MAC address it has seen, it sends that message only to the physical port associated with that MAC address. If it hasn't seen that MAC address before, it'll send the message out to all ports, but, by listening to the responses, it'll figure out which of those ports was the correct one and update its table appropriately, eliminating the need to do this type of flooding very often.\n\nRouters are even smarter. Like switches, they have tables that tell them where to send messages (this time based on Interpret Protocol (IP) addresses). But rather than keeping a table that links individual addresses to physical ports, they can associate entire networks or ranges with ports, and usually employ a *default* *gateway* to route messages that don't meet any of the entries on its table.\n\nMultiple routers can also work in conjunction to dynamically update their tables and route packets across multiple networks in the most efficient way possible.",

        "text":"The gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis), also known as velvet rockfish, the gag, or charcoal belly, is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a grouper from the subfamily Epinephelinae which is part of the family Serranidae, which also includes the anthias and sea basses. It comes from warmer parts of the West Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. It is a drab, mottled-gray fish lacking the distinguishing features of most other groupers. Its pattern of markings resemble the box-shaped spots of the black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci). It lacks the streamer-points on the tail fin that scamp (M. phenax) and yellowmouth grouper (M. interstitialis) have and lacks yellow coloration around the mouth.\n\nDescription\nThe gag grouper has an oblong, robust body which is laterally compressed. The depth of the body is normally less than the length of the head and it is usually roughly equal in depth at the origin of the dorsal fin and at the anal fin origin. The standard length is three to three and a half times the depth of the body. The dorsal profile of the head is convex and the preopercle has a rounded lobe at its angle which has enlarged serrations. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 16 to 18 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 10 to 12 soft rays. The membranes between the dorsal fin spines are notched with the third and fourth spines being the longest. The caudal fin is square. The adult females and the juveniles are normally pale grey to brown-grey marked with darker blotches and wavy lines that give a marbled appearance to the upper flanks and back. The pelvic, anal and caudal fins have bluish-black margins. When resting they often assume a camouflage pattern with 5 dark brown saddles separated by white bars along the base of the dorsal fin. The large adult males are typically pale to medium grey in colour, with an indistinct reticulated pattern underneath the dorsal fin. They are darker grey or black on the breast and belly, with a similar colour on the margins of the soft rayed part of the dorsal find the caudal fin, as well as the posterior margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins. There is also a colour phase called \"black-back\" which has the rear end of the body and all of the soft rayed part of the dorsal fin and the anal fin are black. This species attains a maximum total length of  although  is a more common length, and the maximum published weight attained is .\n\nDistribution\nThe gag grouper is found in the western Atlantic Ocean where it has a disjunct distribution. The northern population is found around Bermuda and along the eastern coast of the United States from North Carolina south to Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico but it is largely absent from Cuba, apart from one record of a vagrant. The southern population is found in southern Brazil from Rio de Janeiro State to Santa Catarina State. Juveniles have been recorded in as far north as Massachusetts.\n\nHabitat and biology\nMycteroperca microlepis has different habitat preferences as a juvenile and as an adult. The juveniles are found in estuaries and beds of sea grass while the adults are found farther offshore over rocky substrates at depths of  and have been recorded as deep as . Adults are occasionally recorded inshore over rock sea beds or sea grass beds. It is one of the commonest species of grouper on the eastern Gulf of Mexico. They can be found both in brackish and marine waters. The adults can be found either in groups of 5–50 fish or as solitary fish. They have been recorded producing thumping sounds when under stress, this is done by vibrating the swim bladder using muscular contractions. The adults are predators on fishes (including smaller conspecifics), crabs, shrimps, and cephalopods while the smaller juveniles prey on crustaceans within the beds of sea grass in shallow waters. The fishes preyed upon are largely herring, sea bream, jacks and pompanos, drums and grey mullet.\n\nThis species is a protogynous hermaphrodite; all fish start life as females, attaining sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 6 years old and having reached a total length of , they will spawn at least once and then some will change sex and become males. In the offshore waters between North Carolina and Florida, between 1976 and 1982, the sex ratio was found to favour females, with 84% of the population being female, 15% being male and 1% in the process of sex change. However, a subsequent study discovered that proportion of males had decreased to around 5.5%, fishing pressures which are concentrated on large males being the probable cause of this result. Although the sex change can occur as early as 5 years old it is more typical for it to take place at 10 to 11 years old and at a total length between . In the Atlantic coastal waters between North Carolina and Florida there are annual migrations in late winter; these migrations involve sexually mature fishes moving to offshore spawning grounds where at depths of . The spawning season in this region runs from December through May, peaking in late March and early April. In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the spawning season runs from late December through to April, peaking in February and April. After spawning the females move towards shallower waters with depths less than , while the males prefer waters of  They maximum recorded age is 31 years.\n\nTaxonomy\nMycteroperca microlepis was first formally described as Trisotropis microlepis in 1879 by the American ichthyologists George Brown Goode (1851–1896) and Tarleton Hoffman Bean (1846–1916) with the type locality given as Florida.\n\nUtilisation and threats\nThe gag grouper is targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries using handline, bottom longline and speargun. Fishermen target the spawning aggregation while the juveniles are frequently caught as bycatch in the bait-shrimp fishery that fishes over sea grass beds. There have been reports of ciguatera poisoning among humans following the consumption of flesh from M. microlepis. This species is threatened by and is vulnerable to overfishing and both Mexico and the United States have introduced conservation measures.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nmicrolepis\nTaxa named by George Brown Goode\nTaxa named by Tarleton Hoffman Bean\nFish described in 1879\nFish of the Atlantic Ocean\nSport fish",

        "text":" Your local school board or state department of education may have its own process for investigating and dealing with issues of discrimination and discriminatory discipline in public schools.Typically you can visit the website of your state department of education or your local school board to find out more about what the process is for filing a grievance.\nKeep in mind that the state or local grievance procedure may have its own deadlines for filing complaints, as well as evidentiary requirements, that differ from those for filing a federal complaint.\nIf you do opt to file an institutional grievance, the deadline to file a federal complaint is extended. However, if you do decide to file a federal complaint you only have 60 days after the conclusion of the state or institutional grievance process to file it.\nIf you file an institutional grievance, you do not have the option of filing a federal complaint while it is still pending.;\n, The DOE website has an online complaint form you can use to report a school for discriminatory discipline, as well as information regarding the types of discrimination they investigate and the eligibility requirements for filing a complaint.On the website, you can read more about the laws the DOE's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) enforces, as well as the types of discrimination which are examples of discrimination in violation of those laws.\nHowever, don't worry about correctly analyzing the activity you believe is discriminatory. The specific legal analysis of the facts is up to OCR staff who investigate your complaint.\nIn addition to a link to a fillable PDF that you can submit online, you also can find instructions if you want to mail or fax a paper complaint.\n\n, The complaint form requires you to provide information about yourself, the name and location of the school about which you're complaining, and the incidents that you believe constitute discriminatory discipline.You don't need to be the victim of discrimination yourself to file a complaint. Anyone who believes a school is engaging in discriminatory discipline may file a complaint.\nHowever, if you're filing the complaint on behalf of someone else, such as your child, you must get consent from your child to file the complaint on their behalf. The DOE has a consent form that must be filled out and signed by the person on whose behalf you're filing your complaint.\nMake sure you include your full name and contact information in case staff reviewing your complaint need to contact you for additional information. You cannot submit an anonymous complaint.\nIf you have documents that demonstrate discriminatory discipline, such as statements in the school's handbook or a letter or email from a teacher, you can attach these to your complaint.\n\n, Once you're satisfied that all the information you've provided is complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge, make a copy of it for your records and then send it to the DOE for review.Generally, you must file your complaint within 180 days of the date of the incident you allege to be discriminatory discipline.\nIf you want to submit your complaint online, you must send it to the email address provided by the OCR and listed on the website page where the fillable PDF is available for download.\nYou also have the option of mailing your complaint to the OCR enforcement office nearest you. The DOE has a list of OCR enforcement offices throughout the country on its website.\n\n, DOE staff in the OCR will review your complaint and may contact you if they need additional information to determine whether the incidents you describe merit an investigation.If you receive a request for more information, you have 20 calendar days to respond and provide the requested information or your complaint will be dismissed.\nStaff may request additional information if there is not enough in your complaint to determine whether OCR has the legal authority to investigate the complaint.\n\n, If the OCR decides to investigate your complaint, both you and the school will receive a letter stating that the complaint has been opened for investigation. The OCR will proceed as a neutral fact-finder, collecting and analyzing evidence.Keep in mind that opening an investigation does not imply that OCR believes discriminatory discipline is taking place at the school.\nThe letter will explain the investigation process and what you can expect at each stage. It also will provide information about the OCR's role in investigating the complaint and what the outcome may be if the OCR determines violations of federal anti-discrimination laws have occurred.\nThe school will receive a copy of your complaint and have the opportunity to respond to it, as well as produce any documents in its defense.\n\n, If you have any documents related to your complaint or that support your claim that the school is engaging in discriminatory discipline, the OCR investigators will review them.You may have already attached documents to your complaint. However, other documents may have come to light since you filed your complaint, or you may have had further correspondence with teachers or school administrators.\nIf you filed a state or institutional grievance, the OCR may request copies of the documents related to that grievance, including any forms you filled out.\n\n, OCR staff typically investigate the person who filed the complaint, as well as anyone else you name as a witness who may have evidence or information about the allegations in your complaint.Answer the investigators' questions as honestly and completely as you can. If you don't know the answer to something, feel free to say so – don't just make something up.\nLikewise, if an investigator asks you a question that you don't understand, feel free to ask the investigator to clarify.\nKeep in mind that OCR investigators are acting as neutral fact-finders, trying to get to the bottom of the situation. They are not on your side, nor are they on the school's side. Rather, they are looking for objective evidence as to whether discrimination has taken place.\nEven if the disciplinary rules themselves are not discriminatory on their face, the OCR still may find the school is not in compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws if the rules are applied in a discriminatory manner, or if the application of the rule has a discriminatory impact.\nAs part of the investigation, OCR staff also may visit the school and observe teachers and school administrators as they carry out their duties.\n\n, When the investigation is complete, the OCR will make a determination of whether the evidence it found was sufficient to constitute a violation of federal anti-discrimination law.Both you and the school will send you a letter of findings that explains the OCR's determination. The letter breaks down your complaint into allegations that each cover a single fact.\nFor each listed allegation, the letter will state whether the investigation has uncovered insufficient evidence to show a failure to comply with federal law, or that a preponderance of the evidence shows a failure to comply with federal law.\nKeep in mind that the letter of finding you receive is only available to the parties in the investigation, and is not a general policy statement. It only applies to the facts alleged in your complaint.\n\n, When the OCR determines that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws, it will request that you and the school participate in voluntary negotiations to resolve your complaint.Through voluntary resolution, you meet with the school and OCR officials in an attempt to negotiate a settlement to the complaint. Resolutions may include changes in school policies and procedures.\nIf the school refuses to participate in negotiations, the OCR may begin administrative enforcement proceedings to suspend or terminate the federal funds the school receives.\nThe OCR also may refer the case to the Department of Justice, which will determine whether a lawsuit against the school is appropriate.\nIf the school does agree to negotiate a voluntary resolution agreement, you will meet with school officials and OCR staff to resolve your complaint.\nOnce an agreement is reached, it is legally binding – however, the OCR does not monitor or enforce the school's compliance with the agreement. Rather, if the school fails to follow the agreement it reached, you must file another complaint with the DOE.\n\n, Regardless of the outcome of your complaint, you may be able to force a change in the school's policies or administration by raising awareness of the school's discriminatory discipline in your community and among parents.You can always start by talking to friends about the discriminatory discipline you've witnessed. If you're a parent, speak to other parents with children similar to yours to find out if they've noticed the same things.\nYou also might consider bringing up the issue of discriminatory discipline at the meeting of a parent-teacher association or organization meeting.\nTalk to teachers as well and find out if any of them have noticed the same things you have and would be willing to speak out against discrimination in the application of discipline.\n\n, There are many nonprofit organizations that take action against discriminatory behavior and violations of civil rights in the educational setting. Find a local or regional office where you can report the discrimination taking place at the school.Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have chapters in each state and are dedicated to fighting discrimination and advocating for equal opportunity to education.\nWhile you can take action on your own, nonprofit organizations already have substantial networks and resources that they can use to fight for you and help you change discriminatory procedures in your school.\n\n, Bringing discriminatory discipline to the attention of state and local lawmakers can motivate them to pass new laws or regulations to address the issue.You typically can find contact information for your elected representatives, including school board members, by visiting your state or county government's website.\nTry to keep your letter brief, and focus on the facts of the situation and any efforts you've made so far to remedy the discrimination you've observed.\nEnd your letter with a call to action. If there is currently a law or rule pending, you might mention that. If not, focus on the need for strong rules to combat discrimination in the application of disciplinary penalties against students and protect all students' equal opportunity to an education.\n\n",

        "text":"Unfortunately, even after reading the authors' response to my pre-review question, I feel this paper in its current form lacks sufficient novelty to be accepted to ICLR.\n\nFundamentally, the paper suggests that traditional iterative algorithms for specific class of problems (ill-posed image inverse problems) can be replaced by discriminatively trained recurrent networks. As R3 also notes, un-rolled networks for iterative inference aren't new: they've been used to replace CRF-type inference, and _also_ to solve image inverse problems (my refs [1-3]). Therefore, I'd argue that the fundamental idea proposed by the paper isn't new---it is just that the paper seeks to 'formalize' it as an approach for inverse problems (although, there is nothing specific about the analysis that ties it to inverse problems: the paper only shows that the RIM can express gradient descent over prior + likelihood objective).\n\nI also did not find the claims about benefits over prior approaches very compelling. The comment about parameter sharing works both ways---it is possible that untying the parameters leads to better performance over a fewer number of 'iterations', and given that the 'training set' is synthetically generated, learning a larger number of parameters doesn't seem to be an issue. Also, I'd argue that sharing the parameters is the 'obvious' approach, and the prior methods choose to not tie the parameters to get better accuracy.\n\nThe same holds for being able to handle different noise levels \/ scale sizes. A single model can always be trained to handle multiple forms of degradation---its just that its likely to do better when it's trained for specific degradation model\/level. But more importantly, there is no evidence in the current set of experiments that shows that this is a property of the RIM architecture. (Moreover, this claim goes against one of the motivations of the paper of not training a single prior for different observation models ... but to train the entire inference architecture end-to-end).\n\nIt is possible that the proposed method does offer practical benefits beyond prior work---but these benefits don't come from the idea of simply unrolling iterations, which is not novel. I would strongly recommend that the authors consider a significant re-write of the paper---with a detailed discussion of prior work mentioned in the comments that highlights, with experiments, the specific aspects of their recurrent architecture that enables better recovery for inverse problems. I would also suggest that to claim the mantle of 'solving inverse problems', the paper consider a broader set of inverse tasks---in-painting, deconvolution, different noise models, and possibly working with multiple observations (like for HDR).",

If you are going to be creating curls all the time, you could end up with severely damaged hair if you start when it's wet., Before you start curling, make sure your hair is free of tangles and snares by running a brush or comb through it., Before you use your curling iron, spray in hairspray to help the curls hold. Let it dry before you start curling your hair., To get extra curly hair, you need to use a small curling iron to create fairly tight curls. A good size is 3\/4 of an inch., It's easier to work your way down when curling your hair., Take a chunk of your hair in your hand to begin curling it.Capture the hair in the iron. Open the handle, and close the hair in it. Pull the iron down until it's almost at the end. Wrap the hair around the iron. Begin twirling the iron so that the hair wraps around it. Stop when you get a few inches from the roots of the hair.Stop with the curling iron perpendicular to your head. Hold the curl in place for about 5 seconds.Release the curl. Open up the iron, and pull the handle down, letting go of the curl., That is, after you make the curl, wrap it around your finger. When you have it wrapped, use a bobby pin to secure it to your head. This process will help your curls set, and it keeps them out of your way as you curl the rest of your hair., As you go, alternate the amount of hair you curl at a time. Doing so will give you curls in different sizes, which will make them look more natural., That is, on one curl, wrap it one direction. On the next curl, wrap it the other way. People with naturally curly hair have curls that go both ways, so it will look more natural if you alternate., Add another layer of hairspray before unpinning the curls., Release the bobby pins, and shake out the curls. Use your fingers to separate them., Use a wide-tooth comb to lightly comb up from the ends. Don't not use a brush on your curls, which causes frizzing. You can also use the comb to tease the top of your hair. Both can add volume and body., That is, scrunch up the curls with your fingers, creating the shape you want.You can also use a product, like wave-enhancing spray, mousse, or gel, to help give your hair body and set the curls.

Imagine starting at one side of a room and traveling in a completely random line to the other side, except that line can't cross over itself.\n\nBut that's just in two dimensions. When you can move up and down as well, things look more complicated. Imagine flying around a room in completely random directions, but you can't be in the same point you were (that's intersecting your path). Eventually, you'd make it everywhere in the room because there's nowhere left to go and you can't go the same place twice.\n\nVery few 3D random self avoiding walks don't contain knots. When you're moving all around in three dimensions completely randomly, it's easy to imagine that at some point you're going to fly in a knot shape. The simplest one is, of course, just a circle with some path going through it. If you have a path like this for long enough, it's near impossible you're not eventually going to travel in a shape that would create a knot.\n\nNow, with actual, real life cords, it's the same concept in a way.

        "text":"  The Eulerian cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear\nmode coupling of density fluctuations. We evaluate the second-order power\nspectrum including all four-point contributions. In the weakly nonlinear regime\nwe find that the dominant nonlinear contribution for realistic cosmological\nspectra is made by the coupling of long-wave modes and is well estimated by\nsecond order perturbation theory. For a linear spectrum like that of the cold\ndark matter model, second order effects cause a significant enhancement of the\nhigh $k$ part of the spectrum and a slight suppression at low $k$ near the peak\nof the spectrum. Our perturbative results agree well in the quasilinear regime\nwith the nonlinear spectrum from high-resolution N-body simulations.\n  We find that due to the long-wave mode coupling, characteristic nonlinear\nmasses grow less slowly in time (i.e., are larger at higher redshifts) than\nwould be estimated using the linear power spectrum. For the cold dark matter\nmodel at $(1+z)=(20,10,5,2)$ the nonlinear mass is about $(180,8,2.5,1.6)$\ntimes (respectively) larger than a linear extrapolation would indicate, if the\ncondition rms $\\delta\\rho\/\\rho =1$ is used to define the nonlinear scale. At\nhigh redshift the Press-Schechter mass distribution significantly\nunderestimates the abundance of high-mass objects for the cold dark matter\nmodel. Although the quantitative results depend on the definition of the\nnonlinear scale, these basic consequences hold for any initial spectrum whose\npost-recombination spectral index $n$ decreases sufficiently rapidly with\nincreasing $k$, a feature which arises quite generally during the transition\nfrom a radiation- to matter-dominated universe.\n",

        "text":"I think students could benefit on attending classes from home  it's less distractions they're in their own comfortable environment.\n When students are at school in most cases they find it distracting because there are a lot of students in class and some of those students are loud therefore, it disturbs the other students  it can be irritating trying to listen to the teacher and do work while others keep talking, yelling, or being being loud while you're trying to concentrate on what you have to do. But when you're home schooled you can be disturbed here and there but it's less disturbing then being around a lot of noisy students and students that turn their headphones up all the way so you can here their music is also a distraction to students and if you're at home doing the work, you're in your own zone.  Being at home also helps if you're nervous around other students or you don't like being around big crowds  When you're at home if feels more comfortable because you're around an environment you know well and that you're used to. You also have your parents at home to help you with your work and your parents keep you on track with your work. It also helps being independent at home by yourself and doing work online because some adults do that when they're in college and have to take online classes.  Another reason is because some students might get bullied and if they feel they're not ready for school then, they should be home schooled so they mentally and physically don't become damaged  If a student says he or she is getting bullied then changing schools can also be beneficial but, I feel like having them home schooled would help them a lot more so they can get more comfortable and find it in themselves that they are ready to be in school again. It can also be a big stress relief for the student as well because they find peace in their own home that they like for an example if the student has a pet that can be relaxing for them and therapeutic to the student and have them calm while doing work because the student can rub the pet to focus more and be calm.  Student also need experience in school to know how it feels,but in all if the student likes it better in their own home I think that is most important and what ever makes the student comfortable so they can keep striving and become successful.",

        "text":"First, the economy. It would be absolutely devastated.   It would start, somewhat ironically, with the corn industry. While corn is use for a ridiculously giant number of things, a lot of it goes towards feed for chickens, pigs, cows and other the other meat that we raise. While some this may be picked up by the giant number of new vegetarians (if the corn they use for that even makes edible food for people), it probably wouldn't be close to using all of the left over corn. And, not only will you have waste of that product, but a lot of people would lose their jobs. Farmers, truckers, all sorts of people working in business that would either totally have to revamp what they do or close down, such as Hillshire Farms or Tyson, and even restaurants that make most of their money from meat, like steak houses or Hooter-style wings places. Of course, it would eventually recover when vegetarian food producers and restaurants take their places and establish themselves as stable businesses.\n\nOne the other had, it would be an incredible things for both the environment and people on the lower economic rungs who have trouble feeding themselves. For the purposes of this example, consider animals as nothing more than food factories, ignoring the moral implications if this were an actual belief. Chickens become the most efficient factory. It takes two pounds of food for the chicken to produce one pound of edible meat, the other half is wasted. The cow, being a much more wasteful factory, I've red numbers ranging from 6:1 to 20:1, the most truthful probably lies somewhere inbetween those row. For the sake of simplicity, let's say ten. That means for every one pound of beef that all of these people would normally eat, there can now be ten pounds of vegetables in its place. That's a lot more food. Of course, most of that would be corn or grain, but the demand for those wild lessen, and those fields would be able to be used for a variety of fruits and vegetables.\n\nBut you must remember, unless the society we are discussing wants to change most things about their lifestyle, some of these animals will still have to be raised and slaughtered. Most parts of many animals are actually used for a number of things you would never expect.\n\nAnother thing that needs to be considered is te health care system. The damage that has already been done by years of red meat would sti have to be treated. And, at first, there would probably be a number of new people going to the doctor because they are mistaking malnutrition for an illness. While, I'm sure you know as a vegetarian, it's pretty easy to have a healthy diet as a vegetarian. But, if you'd don't know how to be a vegetarian the right way, many people would no longer be getting essential nutrients they once got from meat. This, however, I'd imagine, would only be a temporary problem until people educated themselves.\n\nEDIT- On second thought, it would be devastating to the environment if it happened overnight and hadn't been planned for.\n\nA good example of this is deer hunting. In many places where deer are extremely populace, it's a direct result of people killing most of the wolves and predators in the area in an attempt to protect their livestock or to keep dangerous animals away from their homes and families. Because of this, hunters actual have taken their place in the food chain to keep deer population down. Without wolf introduction, if the eating of venison and the hunting of deer stopped, they would eat all of their food, not only starving themselves but also harming much of the flora and fauna in the area, effectively destroying the ecosystem. \n\nSo, with proper planning it would be extremely good for the environment, but without it, it could destroy parts of it.",

A computer is basically a bunch of tiny switches which can be controlled by the presence or absence of electricity.\n\nThe switches can be connected in very complicated ways.

Many further switches can be connected.\n\nThe computer \"knows\" what to \"do\" because the 0's and 1's it reads cause flipping of those switches (and the switches they're connected to, and the switches *those* switches are connected to, and so on...)\n\nWhy do switches flip?  Because they're designed that way.  Modern CPU's are built from pure silicon crystals with a very complicated multi-step process involving light, heat, and various chemicals.  The reason is to create switches which work due to the way atoms with one extra electron, or atoms with one missing electron, interact with the silicon crystal.\n\nBefore chips, computers used vacuum tubes, small bottles with no air inside, which lets you create an electrically controlled switch by using an electric field to guide an electron beams.  They worked, but compared to chip based computers were extremely slow, expensive, broke down a lot, and the power and cooling were a nightmare.\n\nBefore that, in the 1800's, a man named Babbage created a computer out of mechanical switches.

        "text":"Mary \"May\" Morris (25 March 1862 – 17 October 1938) was an English artisan, embroidery designer, jeweller, socialist, and editor. She was the younger daughter of the Pre-Raphaelite artist and designer William Morris and his wife and artists' model, Jane Morris (née Burden).\n\nBiography\n\nMay Morris was born on 25 March 1862 at Red House, Bexleyheath, and named Mary, as she was born on the Feast of the Annunciation.\nMay learned to embroider from her mother and her aunt Bessie Burden, who had been taught by William Morris. In 1878, she enrolled at the National Art Training School, precursor of the Royal College of Art. In 1885, aged 23, she became the Director of the Embroidery Department at her father's enterprise Morris & Co. During her time in the role she was responsible for producing a range of designs, which were frequently misattributed as her father's work. She ran this department until her father's death in 1896, where she moved into an advisory role. \n\nIn 1886, May fell in love with Henry Halliday Sparling (1860–1924), secretary of the Socialist League. Despite her mother's concerns about her future son-in-law, they married on 14 June 1890 at Fulham Register Office. The Sparlings were divorced in 1898, and May resumed her maiden name.\n\nIn 1907, she founded the Women’s Guild of Arts with Mary Elizabeth Turner, as the Art Workers Guild did not admit women.\n\nShe edited her father's Collected Works in 24 volumes for Longmans, Green and Company, published from 1910 to 1915, and, after his death, commissioned two houses to be built in the style that he loved in the village of Kelmscott in the Cotswolds. Her companion at Kelmscott from 1917 until her death was Mary Lobb, a Land Army volunteer in the village.\nMay Morris died at Kelmscott Manor on 17 October 1938.\n\nEmbroidery\n\nMay Morris was an influential embroideress and designer, although her contributions are often overshadowed by those of her father, a towering figure in the Arts and Crafts movement. She continued his resurrection of free-form embroidery in the style which would be termed art needlework. Art needlework emphasized freehand stitching and delicate shading in silk thread thought to encourage self-expression in the needleworker in sharp contrast with the brightly coloured Berlin wool work needlepoint and its \"paint by numbers\" aesthetic which had gripped much of home embroidery in the mid-19th century.\n\nMay Morris was also active in the Royal School of Art Needlework (now Royal School of Needlework), founded as a charity in 1872 under the patronage of Princess Helena to maintain and develop the art of needlework through structured apprenticeships. The school originally opened in the autumn of 1872 in rooms in Sloane Street, London, with a staff of twenty women overseen by Lady Welby and Mrs Dolby, an \"authority in ecclesiastical work\". While the course available in the government schools of design for women was theoretical only, the RSAN had the distinct advantage of a practical, hands-on technical training. The school grew rapidly, and by 1875 had moved into their third locale, conveniently located in Exhibition Road next to the South Kensington Museum. The collections of ancient embroidery in the Museum were studied in an effort to understand and relearn old work.\n\nAlso among the staff at the RSAN were Jane Morris's sister, Elizabeth Burden, who was chief technical instructor from 1880, and designers Deborah Birnbaum (c1889) and Nellie Whichelo (c1890).\n\nMay Morris taught embroidery at the LCC Central School of Art in London from 1897, and was head of the Embroidery department from 1899 until 1905, thereafter continuing her association with the Central School as Visitor until 1910. She also taught at Birmingham, Leicester and Hammersmith Art School.\n\nBy 1916, there were many art schools under the LCC umbrella that included embroidery in their curriculum. Among the embroidery instructors were sisters Ellen M Wright and Fanny I Wright, both previously employed in the Embroidery Department at Morris & Co., and trained by May Morris. Ellen M Wright also taught at the Clapham School of Art, aided by Miss F Pooley, and Eleanor R Harriss and Mrs L Frampton taught at the Hammersmith School of Arts & Crafts.\n\nJewellery\nMorris also designed and made jewellery. She began to design jewellery around the turn of the 20th century, and was probably inspired by the Birmingham jewellers Arthur and Georgie Gaskin, who were old family friends. Examples of her jewellery were donated by Mary Lobb to the Victoria and Albert Museum and Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales.\n\nPublications\n\n  Decorative Needlework.

        "text":" Get down on the floor on your hands and knees. Extend your legs out behind you, balancing on the balls and toes. Place your hands directly under your shoulders with your fingers facing forward and slightly outward. Keep your core engaged by squeezing your stomach muscles. Your body should be in a straight line from your crown to your heels.Don’t allow your body to come out of alignment. A sagging butt or V-shaped hip angle are symptoms of bad form.Hold your arms strong and straight, but don’t lock your elbows. This could lead to injury.;\n, Lift one foot and begin bending the knee as you pull it up between the front of your body and the floor. Bring the knee forward in one smooth, controlled motion. Don’t let either of your knees sag or come into contact with the floor. Once you’ve raised your knee as far as you can, contract and hold your abs briefly but forcefully.If possible, try to touch the top of your thigh to your chest.\nResistance is created by gravity to work the core muscles, quadriceps, hip flexors, and glutes, while the chest, deltoids, lats, and lower back are responsible for stabilizing the plank position., Relax your midsection and push your knee back toward your other foot slowly. Straight your leg and set your foot back on the ground behind you. Then, bring the other knee forward, moving fluidly and squeezing your abs.\n\n\nYou should have one foot on the floor at all times to serve as your base., Return your leg to the floor behind you and begin pulling the opposite knee up once more. Repeat this motion until you get comfortable with it. That’s it! Do as many mountain climbers as you can before you tire out, and try to increase the number over time. This exercise makes a welcome addition to any strength and conditioning workout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMountain climbers take their name from their resemblance to the techniques used to scale steep mountainsides.\nOnce you start getting the hang of it, you can increase your speed until your legs are bounding rather than moving one at a time.\n\n, Before you jump into a weightlifting session or go for a run, run through a couple quick sets of mountain climbers to limber up and get your blood flowing. Mountain climbers make an excellent warm up exercise because they recruit so many muscles at once and actively involve the core. Go until you start getting out of breath, then follow up with some light stretching before you really get to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting your workout with complex, multi-joint movements can save you a lot of time, since you won’t have to warm up each part of the body individually.\n\n, If you want to keep your heart rate up during your workout, fill the spaces between more difficult exercises with simple movements like mountain climbers. They’re strenuous enough to benefit your heart and lungs and provide a little extra resistance training without totally wiping you out. Try doing some mountain climbers at a moderate pace rather than just sitting still on your rest breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly experienced athletes should minimize rest breaks or intentionally increase the difficulty of their workouts. If you’re still new to training, take full advantage of your recovery periods.\n\n, The biggest perk of mountain climbers is their ability to stimulate the muscles of the core. For ab sessions, do a slower variation of the exercise where you really squeeze hard at the peak of the knee lift and hold each contraction for 2-3 seconds. You’re guaranteed to feel it the next day—there’s nothing better for sculpting a tight, toned stomach.The plank itself is a challenging core exercise, making mountain climbers doubly effective.\nUse mountain climbers in conjunction with other core movements such as crunches, leg lifts, and bicycle kicks to hit the upper abs, lower abs and obliques from every angle.\n\n, Instead of using them in the main part of your workout or as a warmup, conclude your session by cranking out as many consecutive mountain climbers as you can. Finishers can be torturous, since you’ll already be drained from your workout, but the number of calories you burn when you give that little bit extra will skyrocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor best results, finishers should be done to the point of exhaustion. However, try not to overdo it.\nYour arms will shake, your back and midsection will burn, and the sweat will flow. Keep pushing through the fatigue.\n\n, Since mountain climbers require proper foot placement and dynamic movement, it’s important to pick out a pair of sneakers with grippy soles that will allow you to change position quickly without worrying about losing your footing. Whatever footwear you choose should also be laced tight to prevent slippage. The last thing you want is to have to sit out the next few workouts because you rolled an ankle.Good shoes will provide much-needed traction and protection on harder flooring.\nIn some instances (such as yoga or martial arts classes), you may have success doing the exercise barefoot, provided you have strong feet and ankles and you’re on a surface like carpet that compensates for grip. Just be careful not to jam your toes.\n\n, This is all you really need to start doing the exercise. Look for a space that will accommodate your full height. Any surface is fine as long as it is flat, free of obstacles and comfortable enough to rest your hands on for an extended period of time. You can drop and do mountain climbers almost anywhere, making them an extremely convenient way to break a sweat.Mountain climbers are perfectly suited for the gym, the office, the beach or the comfort of your own living room. Not having a place to work out is no longer an excuse.\n\n, Keep a clear path between your midsection and the floor for your knees to travel. Be careful not to hit your supporting arms with your knees as you swing them in beneath you. Don’t let your lower back sag or your hips to come up too high: this could throw off your rhythm.Be sure to give yourself enough room so that you’re not cramping your range of motion or bumping into furniture.\nYour knees should move in a straight line. Try not to let them flare out to the sides as you bring them towards your hands.\n\n, To perform sequential mountain climbers, you should be able to hold a plank position for at least 30 seconds. If you have trouble keeping your core engaged or supporting your weight on your arms, build up your plank before introducing any knee movement. Start by holding the position for 10 seconds at a time, and gradually work on increasing the duration while decreasing the amount of rest you take.While you’re focusing on developing the necessary core strength, you can simplify the plank by resting on your elbows rather than fully extending your arms. Keep both forearms in contact with the floor parallel beneath your chest.",

But it does happen once in a while when there is too much chaos in the OR or when there is a systematic failure in the steps taken.\n\nThere are many safety check employed to prevent such incidents.\n\nAll the instruments and pads that go into a surgery are numbered. At the conclusion of a surgery before closure all the hardware and all the pads are counted by the scrub nurse. In addition to this she is expected to keep in her mind the numbers of instruments handled. And when the dirty instruments are sent to the cleaning area the surgical tech also counts them. It is a rule in surgery, nothing leaves or enters an area until it is counted. In case there is a discrepancy the patient is subjected to an x ray and the instrument is retrieved.\n\nSometimes a second x ray is routinely taken to see if there is any bleeding at the surgery site. If there are instruments left inside they will light up and the surgeon can retrieve it.\n\nThe most dangerous are not instuments but broken instruments. Like tips of needles and tips of wires and tips of scalpels. This is where the surgeon's attention to detail comes to play. They by habit are trained to notice everything and be critical about everything. If they notice anything suspicious then they will re measure it and retrieve the lost piece. This is one reason of kind of obsessive personality that we associate surgeons with. They can be very anal retentive and douchey because that makes it safer for the patient.\n\nThe third is ornaments. Surgeons before stepping into OR take off all rings, bracelets, earrings and ask the nurses to do the same. Anyone who can get too close to a patient's open cavity should exercise this. Some are very strict and douchey about it. Some not so and they run the risk of the nurse dropping false eyelashes into the abdominal cavity when she moved for a closer look.\n\nThe insides of a human are very different from what we have been led to believe through color coded pictures. Everything looks the same and structures are flimsy tiny and covered in a layer of blood. The job of knowing what to cut and how to cut and when to cut and where to cut can be overwhelming. That is why these guys study and practice their art all their life and they are paid big bucks. It indeed is a difficult job",

The Secret Service is sworn to protect \"The President,\" and the man or woman who happens to embody that title is secondary to the higher office.  \nSo if the president tells the Secret Service to go away, the Secret Service can tell the president to piss off because they have to protect The President. If, for example, there's an immediate threat, like someone with a gun, the Secret Service will pick up the president and carry him off, regardless of what he says.\n\nFunny story about Harry Truman: On one of Truman's first days in office, he realized that he needed to go to the bank, so he just put his hat on and walked right out the front door. This, naturally, caused quite a bit of panic among his security detail. They raced to catch up and found that Truman hadn't made it more than a block or two before a crowd of admirers had swarmed him, traffic had jammed, and there was a huge knot of chaos right in the middle of downtown Washington.\n\nThe Secret Service shepherded him back to the White House and explained that, from now on, Truman couldn't go to the bank, the bank would have to come to him. Truman later called the Oval Office \"The crown jewel of the U.S. prison system.\"\n\n(I've always liked that story about Truman. It says a lot about him as a person that he expected to wait in line at the bank like anybody else.)",

The raked hopper barges move faster than the box hoppers; they are both designed for movement of dry bulky commodities.\n\nThere are several \"hoppers\" or compartments between the fore and aft bulkhead of the barge. On the bottom of the barge hull, there is (are) also a large \"hopper door(s)\", opening downwards. The doors are closed while the vessel is moving, so she can carry the materials that are to be dumped. The door(s) open when the ship has arrived at the spot where the materials are to be dumped.\n\nSplit barges serve the same purpose, but instead of a door in the hull's bottom, the hull of the whole barge splits longitudinally between the end bulkheads. The vessel consists of two major parts (port and starboard halves), both are mostly symmetrical in design. Both parts of the vessel are hinged at the deck and operated by hydraulic cylinders. When the vessel splits the load is dumped rapidly, which means the barge has to be very stable in order not to capsize or otherwise get damaged.\n\nReferences\n\nBarges\nShip types",

The population was 9,045 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe Town of Hamlin is in the northwestern part of the county and is the second largest town in area in the county.\n\nHistory \nThe Town of Hamlin was created as the \"Town of Union,\" but was renamed in 1861 as the Town of Hamlin in honor of Abraham Lincoln's first vice president Hannibal Hamlin.\n\nHamlin was initially a part of the town of Northampton. The town of Murray split from Northampton in 1807, and split again into Union and Clarkson on December 14, 1852.\n\nThe North Star School District No. 11 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which   is land and   (2.47%) is water.\n\nThe northern boundary is Lake Ontario and the western town line is the border of Orleans County, marked by New York State Route 272 (Monroe Orleans County Line Rd). The south town line borders the town of Clarkson, marked by Clarkson Hamlin Town Line Road that intersects Lake Road (New York State Route 19) south of Hamlin village. The eastern town line borders the town of Parma, marked by Hamlin-Parma Townline Road.\n\nThe Lake Ontario State Parkway passes across the north part of the town.\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 9,355 people, 3,255 households, and 2,532 families residing in the town.  The population density was .  There were 3,503 housing units at an average density of .  The racial makeup of the town was 96.78% White, 1.09% African American, 0.35% Native American, 0.32% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.68% from other races, and 0.76% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.60% of the population.\n\nThere was a myth that Hamlin's name was derived from that of the German city of Hamelin, this due to the fact that many residents in or near the hamlet of Hamlin were descended from German immigrants who had arrived during the late 1800s and settled in that part of the town. This had coincided with the town's renaming from Union in 1861.\n\nThere were 3,255 households, out of which 43.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.7% were married couples living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.2% were non-families. 17.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.86 and the average family size was 3.24.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 30.8% under the age of 18, 8.1% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 6.5% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.5 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $49,987, and the median income for a family was $55,020. Males had a median income of $39,722 versus $24,698 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,978.  About 4.7% of families and 6.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.4% of those under age 18 and 1.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe town is governed by an elected Town Board consisting of the Town Supervisor and four Councilpersons. Support Boards include:\nPlanning Board\nZoning Board of Appeals\nConservation Board\n\nCommunities and locations in Hamlin\nBenedict Beach – A beachside hamlet on Lake Ontario.\nBluff Beach – A location in the northwest part of the town near Troutburg.\nBrockport Yacht Club-- Located on the South Shore of Lake Ontario, near the mouth of Sandy Creek, it is primarily a sailing club.\nHamlin – the hamlet (and census-designated place) of Hamlin on Route 19.\nHamlin Beach State Park – A state park on the shore of Lake Ontario in the northwest part of the town.\nHamlin Recreation Area – A park south of Hamlin village.\nHuntington Park – A location south of Hamlin village and near the south town line.\nKendall Mills – A hamlet on the west town line.\nMorton – A hamlet at the west town line on Route 272.\nNorth Hamlin – A hamlet, formerly \"Thomasville,\"  south of the Lake Ontario State Parkway.\nOnteo Beach – A beachside hamlet on Lake Ontario.\nSandy Harbor Beach – A beachside hamlet on Lake Ontario.\nShore Acres – A beachside hamlet on Lake Ontario.\nTroutburg – A beachside hamlet by Lake Ontario and the Lake Ontario State Parkway in the northwest corner of the town.

        "text":" Most people learn to do foam rolling through a class or a personal trainer. These classes introduce techniques that can help you make the most of your foam roller and give you exercises to use with your roller.;\n, Although it is not round and only rolls slightly, a half-round foam roller can increase your balance when you stand on it. It is often used by physical therapists to enhance proprioception after injury to knees or ankles. Proprioception is your body's sense of its parts in relation to each other.\n\n\nHalf-round foam rollers are also a good choice for an elderly person or someone with little strength or muscle tone. When laid with the flat side down, the roller will not move easily out from under them. Simply laying on a half-round roller in the area of tight muscles can release tension. The user can also move back and forth slightly as they grow comfortable with the roller.\n\n, A decision of firmness should be based on your experience-level with the foam roller. Most foam rollers are color coded according to firmness. White rollers are the softest, followed by blue or green rollers of medium density and black foam rollers, which are the firmest.\n\nChoose a white foam roller if you are just starting off with a foam roller or if you plan to use it for exercises. White foam rollers are often made of a piece of polyethylene foam and they are the least dense, so they will allow some movement between the muscles, bones and the roller. Foam rolling can be painful at the beginning because tight muscles are pushed upon with your full body weight. A white foam roller will produce less pressure and less pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a medium, lightly colored foam roller for advanced core-stabilization or a medium amount of massage pressure. These blue or green foam rollers are often made of closed cell polyethylene foam or EVA foam and they are common in Pilates classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a black foam roller if you are very experienced using a foam roller or desire hard pressure for self-massage. Although most black foam rollers are also made of polyethylene foam, they are closed cell and manufactured under high heat, making them smoother, denser and less porous.\n\n, For heavy use, it is recommended that you use a denser, black foam roller or EVA foam roller because they are highly durable. White and colored foam rollers made of polyethylene foam can warp over time in humidity and with repeated use. If you desire a softer foam roller, be sure to choose a brand that guarantees it will not warp.\n\n, With the exception of half-round foam rollers, most foam rollers have a 6 inch (15 cm) diameter. However, the length of the foam roller differs, ranging from 12 to 36 inches (30 to 90 cm).\n\n\nPick a 36 inch (90 cm) foam roller if you intend to use it on your back. A long foam roller will allow you to roll with it perpendicular to your back, without fear of falling off the ends. It can also be used to create proper alignment by laying on it with the roller parallel to your spine, giving it full support.\n\n, For example, you may want to bring it to a Pilates class and use it at home.\n\n, The cost of foam rollers depends upon the materials used.\n\n\nA 12 inch (30) white foam roller will likely be the least expensive, costing under $15 (10 euros, 9 pounds). White foam rollers cost less because of the lower density of the foam.\nA black foam roller of any size is considered a professional-grade roller and would likely cost around $30 (20 euros, 18 pounds).\nEVA foam rollers are becoming more popular. They are often green. They are moderately firm and offer a more comfortable surface that is warm to the touch. They are advertised as being more durable than polyethylene foam rollers but will likely cost up to $45 (31 euros, 27 dollars).\n\n, Buy your foam roller.\n\n",

If you make a crude animation on a flip book you have to draw everything on each single page and so there is a lot of information in your flip book. However hand drawn animation will use static backgrounds and you only need to redraw what is actually moving in the scene on each page (in this case your pages would need to be translucent so the background remains visible). For example in a shot from the Simpsons the couch may not move and so it is a static background so the animators just need to draw Homer's movements on a clear sheet and \"flip\" through them over the top of the static couch and background.\n\nAt least that's how I understand it, someone with a much better understanding may be able to add to this and\/or describe it more succinctly.",

You should think about what themes might appeal to this age group and how you can connect with children who are at this age level.You may focus more on early picture books, which are written for children ages 4-6. These books are simple and usually under 1000 words. Many picture books are printed in board book format, making them easier to hold and turn the pages.\nYou may focus on easy reader books, which are for children age 6-8. These books have color illustrations on every page but focus on a more grown up audience. They usually have a smaller trim size and the story may be broken into short chapters, with two the five sentences per a page. Often they are 200-1500 words, though they can sometimes be 2000 words long.;\n, You may decide to explore a certain subject category that is popular with children in your book, such as science, history, relationships, or writing and reading. Use a subject category that will appeal to younger children who are just starting to get curious about the world and how it functions.\n\n\nFor example, you may choose to discuss science in your book, where you write about underwater animals or the process of evolution in a fun, interested way using scientific facts. Or you may choose to write about history, where you write about an historical figure in a simple, engaging way. You may focus on a specific time period and explore it in your picture book.\n\n, You should also consider themes that have not been discussed in children’s books in the past or approach a common theme in a creative way. This will help your book to stand out among a sea of books made for children. This theme could be a more general idea like “friendship” or a more specific theme like “friendship between young girls.” You could then approach this theme in a creative, interesting way.You may want to focus more on themes that are simple and still entertaining. You may choose universal themes, such as \"love is everywhere\" or \"share with others\" that will appeal to three to eight year olds. You should avoid complex themes or themes that may go over the heads of younger children.\nFor example, you may decide to write about the theme of “friendship between young girls.” You could then build characters and a setting around this theme, using your own life experiences of friendship or examples of friendship between young girls that you have witnessed.\nYou may want to consider asking any children around you what excites or surprises them. You may also ask them what they are interested in and what they enjoy reading. You can then generate a few possibly subjects for your own book.\n\n, Many children’s picture books contain a positive message or a moral. Often, children’s picture books focus on teaching children a certain value or lesson. You may choose a well known moral or message and brainstorm story ideas around it.For example, perhaps you are interested in exploring the moral of “do unto others as you would do to yourself.” You could then create characters or a storyline around this moral so it is appealing to children.\nWhen using a positive message or moral in your book, you should try to disguise it or keep it hidden. Being preachy and heavy on morals in a children’s book can make the story feel stale and dry. Instead, you should think of ways to place the positive message or moral in the background of your story., With so many children’s picture books out there, you may end up choose a concept that is well known and that has been written about before. This is fine, as long as you try to approach the concept from a unique angle.For example, you may decide to write about bullying. You should then consider how you can approach the topic of bullying in a unique way or a way that has not been done before. You may think about your own experiences of bullying as a child and see if you can focus on a specific detail or moment that feels unique.\n\n, You can get inspiration for your children’s picture book by reading well known examples of this type of writing. You may read:Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak\n\nThe Other Side by Jacqueline Wilson\n\nMr. Tiger Goes Wild by Peter Brown\n\nOscar’s Spots by Janet Roberson\n\n",

The USA and the USSR had nuclear arsenals that were extremely large, extremely varied, and always changing. They were in an arms race. The USA had a lead early on, the USSR was trying to catch up. The USA was strenuously trying to increase that lead. \n\nInnovation in nuclear weapons design requires testing. The USA wanted to do things that were not obvious. They wanted to, for example, find ways of making very, very tiny bombs. They wanted to make bombs with a pretty big boom that fit into relatively small packages. They wanted to make huge bombs that could fit into their existing bombers. They wanted to make bombs that used a bare minimum of fuel, so they could make as many as possible. They wanted to make bombs that were extra \"dirty\" with fallout, and those which were almost totally \"clean\" from it. They wanted bombs that output most of their energy as radiation, and those that would be useful for destroying hardened bunkers. They wanted atomic artillery shells, torpedoes, and land-mines. They wanted bombs that would be extra safe — bombs that could catch on fire, or crash with an airplane, and not detonate. \n\nThey also wanted to do lots of \"basic science\" tests, to learn as much as possible about the details of nuclear detonations, so that they could, in theory, predict as much about how they would work on paper as possible.\n\nAnd they wanted lots and lots of _information_ about bombs. What happens if a bomb is set off under water? What about in outer space? What about if one hits a tank? And so on and so on. \n\nThe USSR was similarly ambitious and they too tested a lot. But the other nuclear states had more modest goals. Their nuclear forces were mainly meant to be simple, minimal deterrents: don't mess with us, we won't mess with you. So they didn't make tens of thousands of warheads of hundreds of different varieties. They needed to make sure they understood the basics of nuclear weapons design, and design the handful of types of warheads they would actually field, and that was most of it. The USA started publishing effects information as well, so that helped reduce the uncertainties there.",

The author has gone into research and has found an idea from NASA that has to do with safe vehicular transportation on Venus  the author describes the idea by statisticly showing how it would work. It is said that NASA's solution is to have the scientists float over Venus' fray like pilots do to fly over thunderstorms.

The author then has provided a section where he explains the problem scientists would have in acquiring samples such as rock, gas, or other items from a far distance  The soulution would be to create an object that would last long enough for scientests to observe the planet's items.

With this type of more resistant technology, the scientist would have more of an assurance of having a successful study and research of Venus.  Even if Venus' atmosphere is far to dangerous for humans to enter, there are ways that danger could be reduced so scientist can study the planet. With the making of compatible vehicles, reliable equipment, the use of older reliable computers, and the lowering of risks, it would make Venus a more worthy planet to explore. ",

        "text":" Your audience needs to know that your character is a vampire. You can state it outright, or, if you want to be more subtle, give clues so your reader (and maybe your characters) can discover the vampire. If you want to build some mystery and suspense (always a good idea with vampires), it is better to show the character is a vampire rather than stating outright.Feel free to ignore certain rules. To make your work stand out, you can ignore or modify certain character traits of the vampire. Unpredictability can be a good thing in fiction. Just make sure you explain these to your audience at some point.If killing the vampire is integral to the story, there must be a way of killing it. If the vampire is the hero, and can't die, then there is little suspense. If the vampire is the villain, then you have given your heroes an impossible task, and the story will only end in failure.;\n, Your character may not need to kill the vampire right away, especially if he is the main villain. You will want your hero to be able to keep the vampire away while he looks for what is necessary to kill it. Some of these actions include:Holding holy objects, like a cross or Bible. Vampires are evil creatures, so the generally reject sacred items. Similarly, vampires resist sacred places, so churches and other religious buildings can be safe spaces. These do not have to be exclusively Christian, so symbols from Judaism, Islam, and other faiths can work. It is important to remember that the symbol itself is not as important as the faith of the person using it.\nSpreading small grainy items like salt or sand. Traditionally, vampires will obsessively count objects they come across, so something small that you can drop in large amounts can delay your foe. Fine grains like oats or rice will also work.\nSimilar to fine grains, vampires may also count the knots in a fishing net. Hanging one over doors and windows will buy some time if a vampire tries to enter.\nHaving certain plants. Vampires resist plants that generally symbolize new life, such as roses, holly, or hawthorn. Other traditions use plants such as buckthorn, juniper logs, blackthorn, or rowan. Your character can have these around the home, or carry them around.\n\n, One good way to kill a vampire (or any other creature) is by cutting off its head. In some genres, the mouth is then stuffed with garlic to prevent the vampire from coming back., There are certain objects, like bullets or wooden stakes, that can be driven into a vampire's heart or chest, that will kill it.Wooden stake. There can be something special about the wood (from a particular tree, or shaped into a holy object like a cross), or it can just be a sharp piece of wood. Some vampire stories in modern day settings use everyday wooden objects like pool cues and coat racks.Like some of the wooden stakes, in many cases there is something special about particular bullets that will kill vampires. They can be silver bullets (as with werewolves), or blessed by a priest to be sacred objects.\n\n, Vampires are evil creatures, and may not react well to sacred objects. Spraying them with sacred water can scald or burn vampires. You'll have to decide if the vampire need to be doused in it, or just a splash will do., In some traditions, vampires need to avoid the daylight, or else they will turn into dust. In other works, vampires move around in broad daylight without any problems.If you decide to make sunlight fatal, remember that most of your action with the vampire will need to take place at night or in dark areas.\n\n, The characters killing the vampire need to be able to accomplish the task, so they need a way to acquire necessary items. If they need holy objects, your characters may need access to a church or priest. If their weapons require a certain type of wood, those trees should grow in your setting.\n\n",

        "text":"So to understand this, it's best to understand skin pigmentation a little. Your skin is colored by special cells called melanocytes (derived from the neural crest in embryos) that are distributed in the basal layer of the epidermis (the bottom portion in the top-most layer of skin). \n\nThese cells are distributed throughout that layer and secrete melanin pigment in little bubbles called melanosomes, that are then passed to keratinocytes (the cells that make up your skin). Keratinocytes take it up and that's what gives people a nice smooth distribution of skin tone in most cases. Think of it as little brown umbrella factories every other block that makes boxes of brown umbrellas and sends them to every person who lives on each block. When it rains and everyone opens their umbrella, the whole city looks brown from above. \n\nA mole is basically a group of melanocytes that have started to replicate and divide rapidly and thus they are considered a \"neoplasm\", but they're not cancerous as the growth isn't out of control. Think of having 5 umbrella factories on a single street. A freckle on the other hand is simply a group of melanosomes (that pigment bubble I was talking about earlier) concentrating together in a specific location. Lets say a bunch of packages get rerouted and all end up at the same house. \n\nInterestingly although melanoma can develop from existing moles, it rarely does. Most melanoma actually arises de novo, or spontaneously on normal appearing skin. It's important if you are concerned about a mole or any skin lesion, to go to a properly certified dermatologist or dermatological surgeon, as they're trained to look for many aspects of  moles that go beyond what we've mentioned, such as layer of the skin it's in, how it's growing, what to look for in metastatic (cancerous) change, etc.",

        "text":"A relief valve or pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of safety valve used to control or  limit the pressure in a system; excessive pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, explosion, or fire.\n\nPressure relief\nExcess pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurized fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the \"path of least resistance\" as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. \n\nIn systems containing flammable fluids, the diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is either recaptured by a low pressure, high-flow vapor recovery system or is routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is burned, releasing naked combustion gases into the atmosphere. In non-hazardous systems, the fluid is often discharged to the atmosphere by a suitable discharge pipework designed to prevent rainwater ingress which can affect the set lift pressure, and positioned not to cause a hazard to personnel. \n\nAs the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising. Once it reaches the valve's reseating pressure, the valve will close. The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats.  The blowdown can vary roughly 2–20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns. \n\nIn high-pressure gas systems, it is recommended that the outlet of the relief valve be in the open air. In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a relief valve will give a pressure build-up in the piping system downstream of the relief valve. This often means that the relief valve will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so-called \"differential\" relief valves are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the area of the opening of the valve. If the valve is opened, the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open. Another consideration is that if other relief valves are connected to the outlet pipe system, they may open as the pressure in the exhaust pipe system increases. This may cause undesired operation.\n\nIn some cases, a so-called bypass valve acts as a relief valve by being used to return all or part of the fluid discharged by a pump or gas compressor back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or gas compressor. This is done to protect the pump or gas compressor and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the fluid path).  Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses.\n\nIn other cases, equipment must be protected against being subjected to an internal vacuum (i.e., low pressure) that is lower than the equipment can withstand. In such cases, vacuum relief valves are used to open at a predetermined low-pressure limit and to admit air or an inert gas into the equipment to control the amount of vacuum.\n\nTechnical terms\nIn the petroleum refining, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing, natural gas processing and power generation industries, the term relief valve is associated with the terms pressure relief valve (PRV), pressure safety valve (PSV) and safety valve:\n Pressure relief valve (PRV) or Pressure Release valve (PRV) or pressure safety valve (PSV): The difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to activate the valve in case of emergency. Most PRVs are spring operated. At lower pressures some use a diaphragm in place of a spring.  The oldest PRV designs use a weight to seal the valve. \n Set pressure: When the system pressure increases to this value, the PRV opens. The accuracy of the set pressure may follow guidelines set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).  \n Relief valve (RV): A valve is used on a liquid service, which opens proportionally as the increasing pressure overcomes the spring pressure. \n Safety valve (SV): Used in gas service. Most SVs are full lift or snap-acting, in that they pop completely open.   \n Safety relief valve (SRV): A relief valve that can be used for gas or liquid service. However, the set pressure will usually only be accurate for one type of fluid at a time. \n Pilot-operated relief valve (POSRV, PORV, POPRV): A device that relieves by remote command from a pilot valve which is connected to the upstream system pressure.\n Low-pressure safety valve (LPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small and near the atmospheric pressure.\n Vacuum pressure safety valve (VPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small, negative, and near the atmospheric pressure.\n Low and vacuum pressure safety valve (LVPSV): An automatic system that relieves by the static pressure of a gas. The relieving pressure is small, negative, or positive, and near the atmospheric pressure.\n Pressure vacuum release valve (PVRV): A combination of vacuum pressure and a relief valve in one housing. Used on storage tanks for liquids to prevent implosion or overpressure.\n Snap acting: The opposite of modulating, refers to a valve that \"pops\" open. It snaps into a full lift in milliseconds. Usually accomplished with a skirt on the disc so that the fluid passing the seat suddenly affects a larger area and creates more lifting force. \n Modulating: Opens in proportion to the overpressure.\n\nLegal and code requirements in industry\nIn most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American Petroleum Institute (API) and other organizations like ISO (ISO 4126) must be complied with and those codes include design standards for relief valves.\n\nThe main standards, laws, or directives are:\n AD Merkblatt (German)\n American Petroleum Institute (API); Standards 520, 521, 526, and 2000\n American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME); Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII Division 1 and Section I\n American Water Works Association (AWWA), storage tanks\n EN 764-7; European Standard based on pressure Equipment Directive 97\/23\/EC\n Eurocode EN 1993-4-2, storage tanks.\n International Organization for Standardization; ISO 4126\n Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR); UK\n\nDesign Institute for Emergency Relief Systems (DIERS) \nFormed in 1977, the Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems was a consortium of 29 companies under the auspices of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) that developed methods for the design of emergency relief systems to handle runaway reactions. Its purpose was to develop the technology and methods needed for sizing pressure relief systems for chemical reactors, particularly those in which exothermic reactions are carried out. Such reactions include many classes of industrially important processes including polymerizations, nitrations, diazotizations, sulphonations, epoxidations, aminations, esterifications, neutralizations, and many others. Pressure relief systems can be difficult to design, not least because what is expelled can be gas\/vapor, liquid, or a mixture of the two – just as with a can of carbonated drink when it is suddenly opened. For chemical reactions, it requires extensive knowledge of both chemical reaction hazards and fluid flow.\n\nDIERS has investigated the two-phase vapor-liquid onset\/disengagement dynamics and the hydrodynamics of emergency relief systems with extensive experimental and analysis work. Of particular interest to DIERS were the prediction of two-phase flow venting and the applicability of various sizing methods for two-phase vapor-liquid flashing flow. DIERS became a user's group in 1985.\n\nEuropean DIERS Users’ Group (EDUG) is a group of mainly European industrialists, consultants and academics who use the DIERS technology. The EDUG started in the late 1980s and has an annual meeting. A summary of many of key aspects of the DIERS technology has been published in the UK by the HSE.\n\nSee also\n\n Blowoff valve\n Rupture disc\n Safety valve\n Surge control\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPED 97\/23\/EC; Pressure Equipment Directive – European Union.\n\nPiping\nPressure vessels\nSafety valves\n\nru:Сбросной клапан (сантехника)",

        "text":"Set (stylized as SET) is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple). Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely once in the deck.\n\nGameplay \n\nIn the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a \"set\". For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.\n\nFor example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squiggles, and 1 solid purple oval form a set, because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three cards are all different.\n\nFor any set, the number of features that are constant (the same on all three cards) and the number of features that differ (different on all three cards) may break down as: all 4 features differing; or 1 feature being constant and 3 differing; or 2 constant and 2 differing; or 3 constant and 1 differing. (All 4 features being constant would imply that the three cards in the set are identical, which is impossible since no cards in the Set deck are identical.)\n\nHistory \n\nThe game evolved out of a coding system that the designer used in her job as a geneticist. The shapes are based on those in ISO 5807. Set won American Mensa's Mensa Select award in 1991 and placed 9th in the 1995 Deutscher Spiele Preis.\n\nGames \n\nSeveral games can be played with these cards, all involving the concept of a set. A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions:\n They all have the same number or have three different numbers.\n They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.\n They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.\n They all have the same color or have three different colors.\n\nThe rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into \"two of  and one of \", then it is not a set.\n\nFor example, these three cards form a set:\n One red striped diamond\n Two red solid diamonds\n Three red open diamonds\n\nGiven any two cards from the deck, there is one and only one other card that forms a set with them.\n\nIn the standard Set game, the dealer lays out cards on the table until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls \"Set!\". The player who called \"Set\" takes the cards in the set, and the dealer continues to deal out cards until twelve are on the table. A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls \"Set\" and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more cards on the table. (To call out \"set\" and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) There may be no set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins.\n\nVariants were included with the Set game that involve different mechanics to find sets, as well as different player interaction. Additional variants continue to be created by avid players of the game.\n\nBasic combinatorics of Set \n\n Given any two cards, there is exactly one card that forms a set with those two cards. Therefore, the probability of producing a Set from 3 randomly drawn cards from a complete deck is 1\/79.\n A Cap set is a mathematical structure describing a Set layout in which no set may be taken. The largest group of cards that can be put together without creating a set is 20. Such a group is called a maximal cap set . Donald Knuth found in 2001 that there are 682344 such cap sets of size 20 for the 81-card version of Set; under affine transformations on 4-dimensional finite space, they all reduce to essentially one cap set.\n There are  unique sets.\n The probability that a set will have  features different and  features the same is . (Note: The case where d = 0 is impossible, since no two cards are identical.)  Thus, 10% of possible sets differ in one feature, 30% in two features, 40% in three features, and 20% in all four features.\n\n The number of different 12-card deals is .\n The odds against there being no Set in 12 cards when playing a game of Set start off at 30:1 for the first round. Then they quickly fall, and after about the 4th round they are 14:1 and for the next 20 rounds, they slowly fall towards 13:1. So for most of the rounds played, the odds are between 14:1 and 13:1.\n The odds against there being no Set in 15 cards when playing a game are 88:1. (This is different from the odds against there being no Set in any 15 cards (which is 2700:1) since during play, 15 cards are only shown when a group of 12 cards has no Set.)\n Around 30% of all games always have a Set among the 12 cards, and thus never need to go to 15 cards.\n The average number of available Sets among 12 cards is  and among 15 cards . However, in play the numbers are smaller.\n If there were 26 sets picked from the deck, the last three cards would necessarily form another 27th set.\n\nComplexity \n\nUsing a natural generalization of Set, where the number of properties and values vary, it was shown that determining whether a set exists from a collection of dealt cards is NP-complete.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nSet Enterprises website\nA (2002?) mathematic exploration of the game Set .

        "text":"Fudbalski klub Obilić (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Обилић) is a Serbian football club based in Vračar, a neighbourhood of Belgrade. It was named after medieval Serbian hero Miloš Obilić, a legendary 14th-century knight.\n\nIn its long history, Obilić Belgrade's most notable success occurred in 1998, when it became only the third club since the breakup of Yugoslavia to win the national league, winning the 1997–98 season. One of the two Belgrade football giants, Crvena Zvezda, former European and World Champion and Partizan, have won every other year.\n\nSince the 2001–02 season, when it finished in fourth place, Obilić has declined steeply: a club which once competed in European club competitions has been relegated to the lowest tier of the Serbian football league system.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginnings (1924–44)\n\nThe club was founded in 1924 by the young Serbs Milan Petrović, Boža Popović, Danilo \"Dača\" Anastasijević, Petar Daničić, Dragutin Volić, and Svetislav Bošnjaković, the first secretary and goalkeeper. One year after its foundation, the club began playing competitively during the 1925–26 season as part of the Belgrade Football Subassociation, an organization under the umbrella of the Yugoslav Football Association. The Serbian football committee was very well organized and was divided into three tiers. Obilić enjoyed early success and moved to the first tier by the 1928–29 season. They would stay amongst the top having finished second once and third three times. This continued until World War II which dramatically changed the structure of Yugoslav football. During World War II, the club played in the Serbian Football League, which usually consisted of ten clubs, and the competition ran from 1941–1944 under specific wartime circumstances. Obilić's placement in that league was usually 3rd, right behind the famous Belgrade clubs BSK and SK Jugoslavija. In the 1942 season they finished 7th; however, that season they acquired Valok, Zečević, Lojančić, Anđelković and Dimitrijević in the team, securing the 3rd place again in 1943.\n\nSFR Yugoslavia (1945–92)\nAfter World War II, the name Obilić was banned by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia which had just taken over Yugoslavia. Considering the name to be \"too Serbian\" because of Miloš Obilić, a legendary 14th-century knight much celebrated in Serbian epic poetry, the authorities forced the club into changing it. The new name became FK Čuburac after Čubura, the neighbourhood where the ground was located. The next big event in the club's history occurred in 1952, when FK Šumadija merged into FK Čuburac. Combined they restored the previous name \"Obilić\" after the government changed its mind and finally let them use the historic name.\n\nThe club rose higher in the ranks in small steps. Starting from 1952, Obilić played in the Belgrade Second Division. In the 1972–73 season, the club finally won the division and was promoted to the Belgrade First Division. They stayed in that division until the 1981–82 season, when Obilić placed fourth in the Belgrade Zone League and moved up to the Serbian Second League North. Proving their momentum, they won the league the following season and were promoted to the Serbian First League. After several years, in the 1987–88 season, Obilić earned the right to compete in the inter-republic league North of the Yugoslav Third League. This was a huge moment for the club, having finally left the small regional leagues for European quality football, now playing against teams from all over Yugoslavia. The club stayed in that third division until the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nRise (1992–96)\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars, all phases of life were affected, including football. In 1992, as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia fell apart, the Football Association of Yugoslavia had lost many clubs. Serbia and Montenegro remained united under the new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Obilić was placed for the 1992–93 season in the newly created Second National League. It took only three years for the club to reach the First National League Group B. Previously, Obilić reached the 1994–95 Yugoslav Cup final, eventually losing to Red Star Belgrade. In the 1995–96 First League debut season, they began to show their potential future top tier competitiveness.\n\nArkan years (1996–2000)\nIn June 1996, the career criminal and paramilitary leader Željko Ražnatović, known as Arkan (his nom de guerre), took over Obilić and swiftly brought \"victories.\" With him in charge, Obilić started a rise to the top of Yugoslav football, which cross-town powerhouses Red Star and Partizan had always monopolized. In the 1996–97 season, the club finished the First National league Group B as 1st, and advanced further for the first time to the First National league Group A (then the league was divided into two groups, A and B, each consisting of 10 clubs). In the 1997–98 season, led by coach Dragan Okuka, Obilić won the league and become the Champions of Yugoslavia for the first time in one of the most remarkable seasons ever in Yugoslav football. In the same season, Obilić also made it to the 1997–98 Yugoslav Cup final, but lost to Partizan and barely missed the double. In the first qualifying round of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League season, Obilić defeated Icelandic club ÍBV by 4–1 on aggregate and played the second round against Germany's record champion Bayern Munich. In the first leg in Munich, Bayern won 4–0 and the return match ended 1–1. Finally, Obilić was eliminated by the eventual runners-up of the 1998–99 Champions League. In the domestic league, the club failed to defend its title, but became the vice-championship of the 1998–99 season, and finished in third place during the 1999–2000 season. During this period, upstart Obilić made an unbelievable run of 47 consecutive league matches without defeat (Round 11 of the 1997–98 season until Round 2 of the 1999–2000 season).\n\nThis feat came amid great controversy. According to journalist Franklin Foer, How Football Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization, Ražnatović threatened players on opposing teams if they scored against Obilić. This threat was enforced by the many paramilitary veterans from his militia that filled their home ground, chanting threats, and pointing firearms at opposing players. Ražnatović's armed thugs even \"escorted\" referees to the matches. One player told the British football magazine FourFourTwo that he was locked in a garage when his team played Obilić. Obilić's ostensible \"wins\" from the era have not yet been vacated.\n\nOver the summer 1998, UEFA considered prohibiting the club from European participation of the criminal connections of Obilić′s president, Arkan. As a result, Arkan stepped down as president in favor of his wife Svetalana \"Ceca\" Ražnatović, in July 1998. Ceca held the role for a short time before ceding it to Žarko Nikolić, who held it for about a year, before Ceca reclaimed it in August 2000.\n\nVertiginous Collapse (2000–2015)\nUnder Ceca's leadership, Obilić achieved third place in season 2000–01, and in the season 2001–02, they finished fourth. This was the last time that Obilić would be considered a top club in Yugoslavia. The next season, Obilić fell further and finished the season seventh. It marked their irrevocable decline. The club who achieved European club competitions began to sink slowly and continuously into indisputable ignominy. In the 2003–04 season, they were still considered \"average\" as managed sixth. In the 2004–05 season, Obilić fell outside the top ten for the first time since its arrival in the First League. Finally, Obilić was relegated to the Serbian First League after the season 2005–06. Obilić finished 15th, with only three wins the entire season. After just one year in the second division, Obilić has again been relegated to the Serbian League Belgrade in the 2006–07 season, ending its 15-year run at the national level.\n\nWith Arkan dead, Obilić fell on hard times. Its humiliation continued as it was relegated to Amateur Level for the 2007–08 season. For the 2008–09 season, Obilić finished last in the Belgrade Zone League and were relegated to the Belgrade First League. For the 2010-11 season, Obilić again finished last, in Belgrade First League, and were again relegated, to the Belgrade Second League. For the 2011-12 season, Obilić finished last yet again, and were again relegated, this time to the Belgrade Third League -- 7 divisions below Serbia's elite football league. The humiliation briefly paused, as Obilić finished champions in Group A of Belgrade Third League for the 2012-13 season, earning promotion to Second Belgrade League. Though Obilić was admitted to Belgrade First League for the 2013-14 season, it was again relegated to Belgrade Second League after collecting only 11 points in 26 matches.\n\nInactivity (2015-present)\nSince 2015, Obilić no longer participates in any organized football competitions. The club still exists on paper and occasionally collects funds from renting out its stadium but the Obilić female team is the only one left in any official competitions.\n\nStadium\nThe club's stadium is also named accordingly to venerate the Serbian knight it is called the Obilić Stadium with a capacity of about 4,550. The team was founded in 1924 and is recognized as one of the oldest active football clubs in Serbia.\n\nTrivia\nWhen Miljan Miljanić stepped down from his presidential post at the Football Association of Yugoslavia in September 2001, the press jokingly cheered Svetlana Ražnatović's election for the post campaigning that she would have been the most beautiful president. However, former Crvena zvezda player Dragan Stojković, known lovingly by his nickname Piksi, was elected to the post.\n\nHonours and achievements\nNational Championships\nFR Yugoslavia First League:\nWinners (1): 1997–98\nRunners-up (1): 1998–99\nNational Cups\nFR Yugoslavia Cup:\nRunners-up (2): 1994–95, 1997–98\n\nObilić in Europe\n\nNotable former players\nThis is a list of players with national team appearances:\n\n Serbia,  FRY\/SCG,  Yugoslavia:\n Dražen Bolić\n Nenad Đorđević\n Nenad Grozdić\n Dragoslav Jevrić\n Saša Kovačević\n Petar Krivokuća\n Nikola Lazetić\n Milovan Milović\n Nenad Mladenović\n Milan Obradović\n Predrag Ocokoljić\n Marko Pantelić\n Aleksandar Pantić\n Radovan Radaković\n Zoran Ranković\n Predrag Ristović\n\n Dragan Šarac\n Miroslav Savić\n Saša Simonović\n Bojan Zajić\n Saša Zorić\n Aleksandar Živković\n Bratislav Živković\nOther:\n Vladan Grujić\n Stevo Nikolić\n Vule Trivunović\n Dragoljub Simonović\n Dejan Antonić\n Antonio Filevski\n Bojan Brnović\n Dejan Ognjanović\n Mirko Raičević\n\nFor the list of all former and current players with Wikipedia article, please see :Category:FK Obilić players.\n\nCoaching history\n Ljubiša Tumbaković\n Dragoslav Šekularac\n Dragan Okuka\n Miroljub Ostojić\n Mihajlo Bošnjak\n Borislav Cvetković\n Ratko Dostanić\n Stanislav Karasi\n Stevan Mojsilović\n Milan Živadinović\n Dragan Lacmanović\n Miodrag Božović\n Zoran Milinković\n Dragoljub Bekvalac\n Dušan Jevrić\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Club website\n Supporters' website\n Supporters' website\n\n \nAssociation football clubs established in 1924\nFootball clubs in Belgrade\n1924 establishments in Serbia\nDefunct football clubs in Serbia\n2015 disestablishments in Serbia\nAssociation football clubs disestablished in 2015\nVračar",

This was not the name used by the Quapaws themselves, however. The term \/akansa\/ was applied to them by Algonquian speakers; this consists of \/a-\/, an Algonquian prefix found in the names of ethnic groups, plus \/kká:ze, a Siouan term refering to members of the Dhegiha branch of the Siouan family.

It showed that the Americans and British took the idea of an atomic bomb seriously and regarded it as a project for the here and now rather than something for the future.  The Soviets were in the middle of an absolutely brutal war being fought on their own soil, and their priorities with regards to military research were quite a bit different from the US at that point.  The fact that the US was seriously working on a bomb gave them a kick in the pants to get their own bomb program going in a serious way.\n\n2.

        "text":" Pacific parrotlets are very active and need plenty of room to fly around. A cage measuring 18” x 18” x 18” is the minimum for one bird. For more than one, you'll need to get even larger cages (28” x 24” x 36” for two birds). The cage should have around 3\/8-1\/2 inch bar space (the spaces between the bars), so that the parrotlet can’t get out unattended., You’ll want to make sure one side is against the wall, though, so the parrotlet can retreat away from a busy room when it wants. You’ll want to keep in mind the following when placing the cage:Don’t put the cage in the kitchen as cooking fumes and smoke are deadly for parrotlets.\nMake sure the cage isn’t in direct sunlight.\nMake sure the room temperature is no more than 80 degrees.\n\n, Aviaries can be much larger cages, and will provide your parrotlets with even more room than the ordinary cage. Some are even 5-6 feet wide!They are great, especially if you plan on keeping more than one bird. However, only one pair should be kept in a single cage or aviary., To avoid problems and sores on the feet of your parrotlets, provide them with at least three or four different kinds and sizes of perches. You may have the traditional swinging perch, and then a branch-type perch, and a rope perch. There are all kinds of perches out there, you may have to try out several to see you’re your bird prefers. Keep in mind that variety is best for parrotlets., You’ll want a variety of toys, including shreddable toys, hard toys with bells (like those designed for cockatiels), and bird kabobs. Finding the right toys for your bird may require some trial and error, but nearly all parrotlets love toys they can tear apart. Make sure you provide a variety, and switch out the toys to keep the parrotlets entertained.Avoid toys with hazards such as movable parts, wire, and string., The liners should be replaced daily, and food and water dishes should be washed thoroughly daily. The cage should be cleaned thoroughly (wiping down cage bars, cleaning perches and toys, and any other accessories, etc.) at least once a month. Sometimes you'll need to clean the cage more often than that, depending on whether you have multiple birds and the habits of your particular bird. When using cleaning supplies, make sure to move the parrotlet first, as the fumes can be dangerous to the bird., This can include carrots, peas, broccoli, and squash, among others. You don’t need to cook the vegetables, but if you use frozen, just make sure they’re thawed properly. Remove any leftovers after about a day.Safe veggies include: asparagus, all bean varieties, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, corn on the cob, cucumbers, peeled kiwi, pea pods, red leaf lettuce, cooked sweet potatoes, and zucchini.\nVegetables to avoid include spinach and other vegetables with Oxalic acid (such as beets and peppers), avocados, and onions., This can include grapes, apples, and berries. Just as with the vegetables, if the fruits aren’t eaten within a day, you’ll want to remove them from the cage. You might want to cut up fruit for your parrotlet, so they can handle it better.Safe fruits include: apples without core, bananas, blueberries, cantaloupe, pitted cherries, grapes, guava, mango, nectarines, oranges, papaya, pitted peaches, pears without the core, plums, pomegranates, prunes, raisins, raspberries, and strawberries.\nFruits to avoid include: grapefruit, starfruit, and tomatoes\n\n, This should be pellet-based rather than seed-based. You can even buy food mixes that are specifically formulated for parrotlets.No matter how high quality the food, it is really important not to rely on seeds as the primary food for your parrotlet. Fruits and vegetables are necessary, so don’t skip on the variety the parrotlets need for a healthy diet.Your parrotlet's diet should consist of about half formulated food such as pellets and half other foods such as fruits, seeds, and vegetables., These include chocolate, fried foods, avocado, and sugar. Chocolate and coffee are detrimental to a bird’s health because of the caffeine and other toxic ingredients.Other foods to avoid include the following:Raw peanuts\nCooking oils\nHerbs and spices\nAloe Vera\nAlcohol\n\n, You’ll want something sturdy that the parrotlets won’t easily break with their beaks (thick glass is good). Parrotlets are often used to food at the bottom of the cage, so avoid the type that attaches to the cage.Make sure the it doesn’t have a cover or hood, as many parrotlets won’t put their head in that kind of dish., However, as many parrots self-regulate, you can keep more food than that in there, especially of the pellet variety. You'll want to clean out excess perishable food at least once a day., You'll want to refresh the water once or twice a day. You might even want to use bottled--but not distilled--water, as some birds like the taste. A water bottle is preferable to a dish, as birds tend to develop more infections when they use a water dish, even if it's regularly cleaned., Sometimes these symptoms can be easily missed, so it is necessary to monitor your bird’s health closely. Often, when birds die suddenly, it’s because the owner thought the bird looked fine, when the bird may have been sick for a while. You’ll want to watch for the following symptoms:Broken or chewed feathers\nChanges in eating habits\nSores (on feet, for example)\nLameness\nFlaky beak or skin\nSwelling or redness around eyes.\nFeather loss around eyes.\nWheezing\nLeaning to one side\n\n, While many of the signs listed above do not warrant emergency care, there are some symptoms that do require immediate care. With parrotlets it can be essential to see an emergency vet quickly if your parrotlet has any of the following symptoms:Significant changes in bowel movements\nSignificant changes in eating habits (Excessive or decreased)\nBehavior or personality changes\nBeing too quiet\nSignificant changes in breathing (rasping, couching, wheezing, etc.)\nInjury\nSignificant change in weight\nSignificant swelling\nNasal, mouth, or eye discharge\nVomiting\n\n, This should be at least once yearly. Once the parrotlet reaches 10 years it might be good to start having checkups twice a year. You should also take your parrotlet to the vet anytime there are significant changes in behavior., This will help the parrot keep from getting territorial and nippy. You want the parrotlet to feel like part of the flock, so make sure to interact with the bird frequently. This is the basis of being able to train the bird. If you can't handle the bird, you will have trouble training it., Parrots actually give their young names--or unique chirp sequences--in the wild, and so you should be able to name your parrot with repetition.You can start with being affectionate with the bird and assigning a phrase to that behavior such as \"I love you.\" Once the bird has made the connection between the word and phrase, you can connect its name by saying, \"I love you, Polly.\" The bird will soon learn its name as the name gets attached to more commands., Pick a treat that you rarely give them but know they love.Nuts and seeds are good training treats, as they’re small, yummy for the parrotlet, and not very messy. Be careful not to use a reward immediately after an unwanted behavior, as you might accidentally reinforce that behavior., A clicker is often used in dog training, and can also be effective in parrotlet training, as it allows you to identify quickly the exact moment the parrotlet does what you want. To get the parrotlet to associate the click with treats, you’ll want to start with simply clicking and treating, until the parrotlet comes to expect treats with each click., Once you’ve identified a specific behavior with a click and a treat, you’ll want to label the behavior with a word or phrase. Pick short words and phrases for best results, such as “sit” or “touch.” Make sure you practice doing this, until the bird connects the behavior with the word. Then you say the word and wait for bird to do the behavior before treating., You’ll need to watch your bird for signs of a pattern in their behavior. Then you’ll need to label the behavior with a phrase such as “good potty” so the parrot starts to associate the behavior with a word or phrase. And you’ll need to reward the bird initially whenever the bird defecates, so they’ll start to be able to control their bowel movements. Once they’ve got this down, you’ll want to give the command on specific occasions or in specific areas, and then reward them for doing as you’ve asked. Finally, you’ll introduce “no” for when you don’t want them to defecate. You may even need to hold their tail down so they get the idea., If you’re struggling with training, or you have a bird that’s too nippy, you may want to invest in a training program. You’ll want to make sure the program has good ratings on the Better Business Bureau website. You may want to check with your vet and see if they have any recommendations for specific trainers or training tips.",

Seniors should always practice proper posture when performing strength exercises with particular emphasis on body stability and back support.\n\n",

        "text":"Floydada ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Floyd County, Texas, United States. This rural community lies on the high plains of the Llano Estacado in West Texas and is sometimes referred to as the Pumpkin Capital of Texas. The population was 3,038 at the 2010 census, down from 3,676 at the 2000 census.\n\nHistory\n\nAccording to the Texas State Historical Association, the community of Floydada was originally named \"Floyd City\". It was established in 1890 on  of land donated by James B. and Caroline Price of Jefferson City, Missouri. Floydada won the election as county seat over Della Plain. When a post office opened, the name was changed to \"Floydada\". The meaning of the name is disputed. Some claim it was meant to be \"Floydalia\" but was garbled in transmission to the U.S. Postal Service, while others insist it is a combination of the county's name and that of James Price's mother, Ada. A third view is that it was formed from Caroline Price's parents, Floyd and Ada.\n\nFloydada became an important railroad junction in 1928, when the Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway reached the town.\n\nGeography\n\nFloydada is located southwest of the center of Floyd County at  (33.983771, –101.337259). U.S. Route 62 enters from the southwest as Ralls Highway and leads east out of town as Houston Street, while U.S. Route 70 enters from the north as Second Street and joins US 62 to exit town on Houston Street. Via US 62 it is  southwest to Lubbock, while US 70 leads northwest  to Plainview. The two highways lead east together  to Matador. Texas State Highway 207 leads north from Floydada  to Silverton.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Floydada has a total area of , all of it land.\n\nFloydada lies on the High Plains of the Llano Estacado around  west of the Caprock Escarpment. Blanco Canyon, a scenic canyon carved by the White River, is  to the south. The terrain surrounding Floydada consists of level plains that at one time were covered with grassland vegetation and populated with bison. The bison were extirpated, and with the exception of Blanco Canyon, the shortgrass prairie has been replaced by plowed cropland, where cotton, grain sorghum, wheat, and pumpkins are grown.\n\nClimate\nThe city of Floydada and Floyd County experience all four seasons of weather. Winters are cool and windy with little or no precipitation with the exception of snowfall. Summers experience a more mild wind and moderately high temperatures.\n\nThe following is a list of average climate data to give a general idea of the weather in the area. Note these values are averages and estimates. They are not intended to provide precise data in a given time frame.\n\nDemographics\n\n2020 census\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,675 people, 1,104 households, and 789 families residing in the city.\n\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 3,676 people, 1,304 households, and 980 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,811 people per square mile (699\/km). There were 1,507 housing units at an average density of 742\/sq mi (287\/km). The racial makeup of the city was 70.35% White, 4.13% African American, 1.09% Native American, 0.14% Asian, 22.20% from other races, and 2.09% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 51.63% of the population.\n\nThere were 1,304 households, out of which 38.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.8% were married couples living together, 12.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.8% were non-families. 23.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.74 and the average family size was 3.24.\n\nIn the city the population was spread out, with 31.6% under the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 23.6% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 16.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.6 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $25,429, and the median income for a family was $30,038. Males had a median income of $25,179 versus $17,381 for females. The per capita income for the city was $12,431. About 24.7% of families and 26.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 36.2% of those under age 18 and 19.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEducation\n\nThe city is served by the Floydada Independent School District. Apple Inc. has teamed up with Floydada to distribute laptop computers to the students and staff of Floydada's Jr. High and High School. In 2007–2008, Floydada was the only town in Texas to be an Apple distinguished school.\n\nWorkforce development\nFloydada has a number of free training programs provided by the Floydada Professional Development Center and the Floydada Economic Development Corporation (EDC). Employers can access financial assistance for training through the Skills Development Fund and the Self-Sufficiency Fund administered by the Texas Workforce Commission. Local training facilities include Caprock Community Action and the Floydada Technology Center.\n\nThe Floydada Technology Center (FTC) began in 2003 and is provided by the Floydada EDC and is housed in the EDC offices at 105 South 5th Street. The Center itself was designed to provide workforce development to both citizens and businesses upon request. It houses a twelve student capacity classroom with an instructor's podium and computer that is attached to a projector. Caprock Community Action was opened in 2002 and operates a learning lab that offers citizens the opportunity to earn their GED.  They are located at 701 E. Lee Street.\n\nCoronado site\nArchaeologists from Wichita State University excavated in Blanco Canyon,  south of Floydada. They discovered significant evidence that Spanish explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado established a major camp there during his search for Quivira, one of the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. The Floyd County Historical Museum in downtown Floydada displays some of the significant artifacts from Coronado's campsite. Also, an historical marker in Blanco Canyon tells of Coronado's expedition, which led through the canyon.\n\nWind energy development\nFloydada is located in what many call the wind corridor of the United States. The wind corridor stretches through the Great Plains from the Texas Panhandle up into Minnesota, including some of the most wind-rich states in the country.\n\nThe region is ideal for wind development because of its wind quality, the potential to connect into two different electric grid systems, and the plan scheduled for transmission build-out in the area.\n\nThe quality of wind is ranked on a scale of one to seven. In Floyd County the wind ranking is class 4, which is considered good for wind energy development. Texas is served by several electric grid operators. Those operating in the Floyd County area are the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). It is beneficial for the area to be in such close vicinity to both grids, because it allows for the opportunity to send electricity generated from wind farms either direction. Even though Floyd County is located primarily in the SPP grid, lines can be built in the area that connect to the ERCOT grid. In January 2009 the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) chose several transmission service providers (TSPs) to construct a build-out of transmission lines across the state of Texas. The purpose of the transmission overhaul was to help harness the wind-rich regions of West Texas and the Texas Panhandle in order to send the energy generated into more populated areas of Texas where the energy can be used. Two TSPs have Floyd County included in their study area, Sharyland Utilities and Wind Energy Transmission Texas (WETT). The Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) project in Texas has the potential to help spur wind energy development in Floyd County. Xcel Energy is also making plans to construct a transmission line through Floyd County.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe region's economy is based on agriculture, but local companies provide services such as custom-built, metal-assembly, irrigation-motor development, efficient rock-crushing systems, and a product called the \"Row Stalker\".\n\nNotable people\n\n Price Brookfield (1920–2006), college and professional basketball player\n Max F.

        "text":"Sandown Park railway station is located on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines in Victoria, Australia. It serves the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Springvale, and it opened on 19 June 1965.\n\nHistory\n\n1889-1955\nSandown Park originally opened on 12 August 1889 as Oakleigh Racecourse. It was renamed Sandown Park in 1892. Named after Sandown Park in Surrey, England, the station was built to service the nearby Sandown Racecourse, and was only used for racecourse traffic.\n\nUpon opening, the station did not feature in any timetables for the Eastern line. By 1892, it was featuring in timetables for the first time.\n\nBy 1909, in addition to the two main lines, there was a signal box and booking office located at the up end of the station, and two sidings each over 600 metres long on the eastern side of the tracks, for the stabling of special race services. The station had no platform on the up track, instead having an island platform on the down track, with the other face serving one of the sidings on the eastern side.\n\nBy 1929, four sidings existed at the down end of the station, parallel to the main lines. In 1937, a crossover at the down end of the station was abolished and, in 1943, three sidings that adjoined the back platform road were abolished. By 1954, the back platform road and the remaining siding were placed out of use. On 16 May 1955, Sandown Park was closed.\n\n1965-present\nOn 19 June 1965, Sandown Park reopened as an island platform, coinciding with the first race day meeting at the adjacent racecourse. Like the first station, it was open for passengers on race days only. On October 4 of that year, it was opened for general passenger traffic.\n\nThe station once had a second exit and a pedestrian underpass at the up end of the platform, but that has since been closed and filled in.\n\nNearby, towards Noble Park, the Corrigan Road level crossing was removed in 2018, as part of the Victorian Government's Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP).\n\nPlatforms and services\n\nSandown Park has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains' Pakenham and Cranbourne line services.\n\nPlatform 1:\n  all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street\n  all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street\n\nPlatform 2:\n  all stations and limited express services to Pakenham\n  all stations services to Cranbourne\n\nFuture services:\nIn addition to the current services, the Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail proposes linking the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines to both the Sunbury line and under-construction Melbourne Airport rail link via the Metro Tunnel.\n  express services to West Footscray and Sunbury (2025 onwards)\n  express services to Melbourne Airport (2029 onwards)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Melway map at street-directory.com.au\n\nRailway stations in Australia opened in 1889\nRailway stations in the City of Greater Dandenong",

        "text":"Science is always difficult for a widespread public to understand. It has a language of its own that does not always translate into common usage; for instance, \"theory\" and \"uncertainty\" aren't used the same way in scientific discourse as they are normally. \n\nWhen you have a scientific issue which has economic and political implications for powerful people, there is an opportunity for exploitation of this lack of understanding. What some very powerful companies and people learned a few decades back, especially during the battle against the tobacco industry, is how to *prevent the general public from understanding scientific evidence* and accept counter-factual narratives which preclude them from demanding public policy shifts. There is a common strategy: at first, deny the scientific evidence outright, and keep at that until it stops working; then *emphasize uncertainty* and claim there is no consensus. Or claim that other factors are causing the problem, or both, or alternate depending on what seems to be taking hold. That is why you now hear fewer and fewer people (the president-elect and his incoming team being extraordinary, deeply alarming exceptions) claiming that warming isn't happening at all. Now, people typically claim that warming is due to other possible causes. \n\nPlease [watch this excellent lecture by Prof. Naomi Oreskes](_URL_0_), given back in 2007. She subsequently developed a lot of this information further, into a book and a movie.",

        "text":" Typically, the law where the employee lives will apply.\n\n\nCourts don’t like non-compete clauses. If your clause is challenged and you’ve included a provision that another state’s law applies, the judge may strike it with regard to the non-compete clause.In some states, such as California, non-compete clauses are illegal. Other states such as Texas have laws that support employees over employers with regard to these clauses.If you’re unsure about the law in your state, consult an attorney first. A business attorney will be up-to-date with any trends in the law and know how courts are handling cases with these contract provisions.;\n, Even if non-compete clauses are valid in your jurisdiction, no contract or agreement is legally enforceable without consideration.\n\n\nIf the clause is included in an initial employment contract, the offer of employment typically provides consideration for the entire contract including the clause.\nIf you’re asking an employee or contractor to sign the clause separately after they’ve already started working, it must have additional consideration such as a raise or promotion., Your non-compete clause does not need to become boilerplate in all of your employment contracts, and should be used sparingly.\n\n\nAnalyze the position of every employee you ask to sign a non-compete clause. Only use the clause for those who actually play a large role in your company and have significant access to valuable information.\nGeneral agreements signed by every employee usually won’t hold up in court if challenged.The purpose of the clause should be to protect your information and keep former employees from using it to their personal advantage, not to punish employees for leaving., Non-compete agreements also have a confidentiality component, and keep former employees from using sensitive business information to their own personal benefit or disclosing it to competitors.Non-compete agreements typically include a provision that an employee who leaves the company will promptly return any manuals, customer lists or other documents to the employer., You don’t want to prohibit former employees from engaging in too many types of businesses. Stick to activities that would significantly harm your business.\n\n\nSome standard prohibited activities include soliciting the company’s clients, attempting to hire the company’s employees or encouraging other employees to leave, or competing with the business directly as the owner of a similar business.For example, if you own a cupcake bakery, you may have your head baker sign a non-compete clause which forbids her from opening her own cupcake bakery across the street from yours using the same recipes she used to bake cupcakes for you.\n\n, Your primary interest should be in protecting the investment you’ve made into researching and developing your processes and client base.\n\n\nThe legitimate purpose of non-compete clauses is to keep someone from taking advantage of your employee training to learn all of your secrets, then open their own shop using those secrets and put you out of business.\nBeyond simply identifying key trade secrets you want to protect, emphasize the time and effort you’ve invested in building those assets.\n\n, You will have to go to court to enforce the agreement, but specifying particular remedies in the clause itself may lessen the risk of having your lawsuit thrown out.\n\n\nSpecifying injunctive relief allows you to go to court and have the judge issue an order for the employee to cease whatever activities violate the agreement.\nYou can also specify particular damages or require the violator to pay your court costs and attorney’s fees., The length of time restrictions last is one of the most important factors for judges in determining whether the clause is reasonable.\n\n\nGenerally, a non-compete clause effective for six months to two years will be considered reasonable.\nA judge would look closer at any period longer than two years to determine if it was really necessary.However, reasonable duration depends on the facts of the case, and some circumstances may call for a longer restrictive period. For example, if the goal of your non-compete clause is to protect confidential client lists, your clause should last as long as that information would legitimately have value., Some aspects of your business may have value for a longer term than others, and a clause that reflects that may be more likely to be enforced.\n\n\nFor example, you may restrict former employees from using confidential information for a period of two years, but restrict other activities only for six months.\nKeep in mind that in many states, courts will simply void the clause in its entirety rather than modifying it. This means that if a judge thinks the restrictions last too long, he will refuse to enforce the clause at all rather than only enforcing it for a shorter period of time., Courts in every state have held that non-compete agreements are only enforceable if they are limited to a specific geographic location.\n\n\nUse specific language when describing the geographic scope of your clause’s restrictions. For example, instead of writing that the former employee may not perform certain activities “in this county or any surrounding county,” list the names of the specific counties in which the restriction applies.\nAppropriate geographic scope depends to a large extent on what the employee does for you and what she’s likely to do when she leaves.To return to the cupcake shop example, you might restrict your head cupcake baker from opening her own bakery or becoming head baker for a competitor within a few blocks of your cupcake shop. However, a non-compete clause seeking to restrict your cashier from becoming a cashier at another cupcake bakery would likely be void.\nYour clause is more likely to be upheld if its geographic scope is as narrow as possible.Courts typically won’t enforce a clause that attempts to prevent former employees from working in locations where you don’t do business., Just as you may want to restrict certain activities for longer periods of time than others, there may be some activities that are less permissible the closer they are to your primary location.\n\n",

        "text":" For example, Monday - 1 hour, Tuesday - 1 1\/2 hours, Wednesday - 1\/2 hour, etc. On days where you have other planned activities, whether it's an extracurricular activity or chores or quality time with your family, you will have less time for homework.;\n, At the end of the day, if you're really tired and still have homework, go to bed and set your alarm perhaps an hour or two earlier than what you usually do. This way when you do your homework you will have more energy and be able to complete it faster. You also won't have to worry about it after school, when you are tired.\n\n, If you don't get motion sick in the car or on public transportation, try to do some of your homework on your way to a basketball game or on your way home from school. But be careful, as your writing may be messy.\n\n, Don't be fooling around with your friends and then come home annoyed that you have a lot of homework. This will make you more grumpy and you will probably get told off by your teachers as well. Don't let your friends distract you.\n\n, If you have a free period, don't use it to hang out with your friends at a local pizza place, use it to catch up on your homework. You will have time to hang out with your friends after school or on a weekend, make homework your first priority.\n\n, Unless you have plans on Friday after school, try to do all your homework for the weekend then. It will be easier to enjoy the weekend without having to worry about your homework. What a lot of people do is not do their homework on Friday, and wait until Sunday night to do it so you have all weekend (including Friday) to do whatever. This may sound like a good idea now, but while you are going out to a party or whatever on Saturday night, all you will be able to think about is having to do your homework the next night. Then on Sunday, you will be tired and won't have a good attitude to do your homework.\n\n, If your environment is in your living room with all your siblings and parents around, that probably isn't the best choice of environment. You will easily get distracted by your siblings asking you questions or the TV noise in the background. A good choice will probably be your own bedroom (with the door shut) or, if you have one, a study. Make sure your family knows you are doing your homework, otherwise they might walk in while you are working on studying for your math test tomorrow.\n\n, Obviously this helps because you don't want to get home and when you are about to do your homework, you realize you have left your textbook at school.\n\n, List games, projects, essays and more. It will be easier to know what homework you have and the details. Then sort out what times and what days you have your out of school activities. Write down the time periods of when you don't have something planned. Assign a subject of homework to that time period. This leads to using your spare time. If you don't have an activity one day, try to do your homework for other days also to get it out of the way.\n\n, You cannot plan your homework time effectively if you do not know exactly what to do. Record the following information:\n\n\nThe subject or course in which the work is assigned (for example, Spanish, algebra, French or English)\nKnow what you're expected to hand in or do and ask if you do not understand (for example, turn in an essay, develop a PowerPoint presentation, or take a test.)\nThe details of your assignments (for example, double-spaced or single-spaced, blue ink or black).\nPage numbers (which pages you need to read, study, or refer to complete your assignment.)\nDue date of the assignment.\n\n, Be realistic. It is better to block out more time than less. If you finish early, you can use your bonus time for another subject. Remember that if you have extra time left over, you can reward yourself by doing something other than homework.\n\n, This is an optimal dynamic scheduling policy. If it is humanly possible to meet all the deadlines, earliest deadline first policy will work. That means, if you get a new assignment due the next day, you need to suspend all work due in 2 days and work on the next day's assignment. However, if you cannot meet any deadlines, you will miss them randomly with EDF. To solve this problem, if you cannot meet all the deadlines, use a static priority rate-monotonic policy. Find the course that releases new homework the most frequently, and list it the highest (do the work first), and so forth. This is mathematically optimal among all static-priority scheduling policies. In other words, if ANY static priority scheme can meet all the deadlines, the rate-monotonic static priority scheme will meet all the deadlines, too. When the static priority scheme misses deadlines, it is deterministic - the lowest priority class assignments will be skipped, so it behaves predictably when you are overloaded. If certain assignments have the same due date, then start with the one(s) that are hardest or will take the longest.\n\n, Look at your assignments and consider how much time you need to devote to each. Find time in your homework schedule to get it done, preferably a day early.\n\n\nIf you have a five-page English paper due on Friday, evenly spread the total amount of hours you believe it is going to take to complete the paper between each day.\n\n, This will stop you from getting too overwhelmed and frustrated during long stretches of homework time and will help you to keep your mind focused. A ten-minute break for each hour of homework done is a good guideline. Use this time to stretch, wash your face, walk around the block, unload the dishwasher for your parents, get something to drink, or do anything that won't tempt you to delay your return to homework. Do not extend the time you take to refuel (such as getting your juice) and do not start with activities that relate to goofing off.\n\n, Once you have your schedule, follow it, or else all the planning in the world is useless. Your plans won't work if you won't work.\n\n, Don't spend the first 20 minutes at home complaining about your homework, because in that amount of time you could have done some homework. It really is pointless complaining, because you are going to have to do it anyway.\n\n",

Communism is a subset of socialism in which the means of production are owned by the people directly, rather than the state, in an attempt to establish economic equality among people. Socialism is simply a broad term which encompasses communism. \n\n2: In practice, we are almost never using these terms correctly. There has been no large scale successful communist state, be definition, just as \/u\/Nothos927 said. The countries we so often call communist would in fact be better described as fascist socialist states, because although the state controls the means of production, that power is not shared with the people. Instead, the state exercises totalitarian control over industry, thereby becoming considerably more powerful, and directly conflicting with the core ideology of communism. The countries we call socialist in Europe are really closer to social democracies, which are like socialist\/capitalist hybrid economies; they have social programs financed by the government, but the means of production is not held exclusively by the government. In short, when we're talking about communists, we're really talking about fascistic socialism, and when we're talking about socialists we're really talking about socialist\/capitalist democracy.\n\nEdited for clarity\/I forgot to put articles places =)",

        "text":" Try to remember what happened at the moment that you were injured. This may be difficult, especially if you are in a great deal of pain. However, your experience at the moment of injury may provide clues.\n\n\nHow fast were you moving? If you were moving at a very high speed (e.g., skiing or running at top speed), there is a chance your injury is a bone fracture. This will require professional medical attention. A lower speed injury (e.g., rolling your ankle while jogging or walking) is more likely a sprain that may heal on its own with proper care.\nDid you feel a tearing sensation? In many cases you will, in the case of a sprain.Was there a popping or snapping sound? This can occur with a sprain.It is also common with a bone fracture.;\n, In the case of a sprain, your ankle will become swollen, usually immediately.Examine your ankles side-by-side to see if the injured one looks larger. Pain and swelling will usually occur in ankle sprain or fracture.\n\n\nFoot or ankle deformity and unbearable pain usually indicate ankle fractures. Make sure to use crutches and go to your doctor immediately.\n\n, A sprain also often causes bruising.Examine the ankle for signs of discoloration resulting from bruises.\n\n, A sprained ankle will often feel tender. Gently touch the injured area with your fingers to see if it is painful to the touch., Stand up and gently put some weight on the injured ankle. If it is painful to put weight on the ankle, it could be sprained or fractured. Get medical attention immediately and use crutches.\n\n\nFeel for a \"wobbliness\" in the ankle. A sprained ankle often feels loose or unstable.In the case of a severe sprain, you may not be able to put any weight on the ankle at all, or use that foot to stand. Doing so will cause too much pain.Use crutches and seek medical attention immediately.\n\n, Ankle sprains come in three different grades. Treatment options will be determined based on the severity of the injury. The least severe is a grade I sprain.This is a minor tear that doesn't affect your ability to stand or walk. While it might be uncomfortable, you can still use your ankle normally.\nA grade I sprain may result in minor swelling and pain.\nIn a minor sprain, swelling will usually go away in a few days.Self-care is usually enough for a minor sprain., A grade II sprain is a moderate injury. It is an incomplete but substantial tear of a ligament or ligaments.In a grade II sprain, you will not be able to use your ankle normally and will have trouble putting weight on it.\nYou will experience moderate pain, bruising, and swelling.\nThe ankle will feel loose and may look as if it has been pulled forward somewhat.\nFor a grade II sprain, you will need medical attention and may need to use crutches and an ankle brace for a while to walk.\n\n, A grade III sprain is a complete tear and loss of the structural integrity of the ligament.With a grade III sprain, you will be unable to put any weight on the ankle and will be unable to stand without help.\nPain and bruising will be severe.\nThere will be significant swelling (more than 4 cm) around the fibula (calf bone).\nThere may be notable foot and ankle deformity and high fibular fractures just below the knee, which can be determined by a medical examination.\nA grade III sprain requires the immediate attention of a doctor.\n\n, A fracture is a bone injury that is especially common with high-speed ankle injuries in the healthy population or minor falling injuries in the elder population. The symptoms are often similar to a grade III sprain. A fracture will require X-rays and professional treatment.\n\n\nA fractured ankle will be very painful and unstable.\nA minor or hairline fracture may be identical in symptoms to a sprain, but only a trained medical professional with X-rays can diagnose or rule this out.\nA popping sound at the moment of injury may be evidence of a fracture.\nAn obvious foot or ankle deformity, such as your foot laying in an unusual position or angle, is definite evidence of a fracture or ankle joint dislocation., Regardless of the degree of your injury, it is a good idea to contact your doctor if the pain and swelling continues for more than one week, to determine the best treatment.\n\n\nIf you see any evidence of a fracture and\/or a grade II or grade III sprain, you must see a doctor. In other words, if you cannot walk (or experience significant difficulty doing so), have a numb feeling in the area, are suffering extreme pain, or heard a pop at the time of the injury, see a physician.You will need X-rays and a professional examination to determine treatment.\nSelf-care is often adequate for a minor sprain. But, a sprain that doesn't heal properly may lead to ongoing pain or swelling. Even if you only have a grade I injury, contacting your doctor for advice is the best course of action., While waiting to see a doctor, you can use a self-care regimen referred to as RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression splinting, and Elevation). This is an acronym that stands for the four treatment actions. For a grade I sprain, RICE may be all the treatment you need The first step is to rest the ankle.Avoid moving the ankle, and immobilize it if possible.\nIf you have cardboard handy, you can fashion a temporary splint that will protect the limb from any further injury. Try to splint your ankle so it's set in a normal anatomical position.\n\n, Putting ice on the injury can reduce swelling and discomfort. Get something cold to put on the ankle as soon as you can.Place some ice in a bag gently on the joint. Cover it with a washcloth or towel to avoid possible frostbite on your skin.\nA bag of frozen peas also makes a good ice pack.\nIce the injury for 15-20 minutes at a time, every 2-3 hours. Continue icing the injury in this way for 48 hours., For a grade I sprain, compressing the injury with an elastic bandage can help provide stability and reduce the risk of another injury.Wrap the area with bandage using a \"figure-eight\" pattern around the ankle.\nDon't wrap it too tight, or you may worsen swelling. You should be able to get a finger between the bandage and your skin.\nIf you believe you have a grade II or grade II sprain, seek a doctor's advice before applying compression.\n\n, Elevate the limb above your heart. Place your foot up on two pillows. This will decrease blood flow to the area and allow the swelling to improve.Elevation will assist gravity in clearing the swelling, and help the pain.\n\n, To help manage the pain and swelling, you can take NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Common over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (trademarked names include Motrin, Advil), naproxen (trademarked as Aleve), and aspirin. Acetaminophen (also called Paracetamol or trademarked Tylenol) is not an NSAID and does not manage inflammation, but it can help reduce pain.Take only as directed on the packaging, and don't take NSAIDs for pain for more than 10-14 days.\nDo not give aspirin to children under the age of 18 due to the risk of developing Reye syndrome.\nFor severe pain and\/or a grade II or III sprain, your doctor may prescribe a narcotic to take for the first 48 hours.\n\n, Your doctor may suggest a medical device to help you move around and\/or immobilize your ankle. For example:You may need crutches, a cane, or a walker. Your level of balance will determine which is best for your safety.\nDepending on the level of injury, your doctor may recommend using a bandage or ankle brace to immobilize the ankle. In severe cases, an orthopedic surgeon may put your ankle in a rigid cast.\n\n",

        "text":"West Virginia Route 9 (WV 9) is a major east–west state highway located in the eastern extents of West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle. The western terminus of the route is at the Maryland state line north of Paw Paw, where WV 9 becomes Maryland Route 51 (MD 51) upon crossing the Potomac River. The eastern terminus is at the Virginia state line at Keyes Gap near Mannings, West Virginia, where WV 9 continues onward as Virginia State Route 9 (SR 9).\n\nWith no east–west US Highway in the region, WV 9 acts as the major east–west transportation artery between Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson counties. WV 9 briefly enters Hampshire County where it intersects with WV 29 near Pin Oak.\n\nHistory\n\nConstruction\n\nWV 9 recently underwent a major upgrade.\n\nU.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd began securing funding for the projects in the early 1990s. Shortly thereafter, a short portion of the road along the southern edge of Martinsburg was upgraded to four lanes, from Queen Street to Kelly Island Road. In the mid-2000s, a short stretch was also upgraded to four lanes from Interstate 81 (I-81) west to Harlan Springs Road.\n\nThe next significant improvement did not take place until September 2007, when a  stretch of the upgraded road opened up from Charles Town, through Bardane to Leetown Road in Kearneysville.\n\nIn early 2008, the future west-bound lanes of traffic were opened to two-way traffic from Kelly Island Road to, and over, Opequon Creek. This allowed for the former road surface to be pulled up and the eastbound lanes to be built. It also allowed for the demolition of the old bridge over the Opequon, which had been the site of several fatal accidents.\n\nIn April 2009, a short  section of the new WV 9 was opened from the Eastern Regional Jail to the Opequon Creek bridge. A  section of WV 9 from the Eastern Regional Jail to Short Road was completed at the end of 2009. Construction from Short Road to Leetown Road was completed in August 2010.\n\nThe stretch from the Virginia line to Charles Town was the most recent stage of construction. A pair of new bridges span U.S. Route 340 (US 340) south of Charles Town. The bypass carries WV 9 away from its previous winding route across the Shenandoah River and the Blue Ridge. Instead, it follows a straight path near Cattail Run Road, connecting with Virginia Route 9 at Keyes Gap.\n\nDespite opposition from some Virginia residents, who were concerned about increasing traffic along the narrow, winding stretch of SR 9 through the town of Hillsboro, this stretch of road opened to traffic on November 14, 2012.\n\nNaming dedication\nIn April 2008, a section of the road, which passes by his Gap View Farm home, was named and dedicated in Frank Buckles's honor by then-West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin.\n\nMajor intersections\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nWVDOT WV Route 9\n\n009\nWest Virginia Route 009\nWest Virginia Route 009\nWest Virginia Route 009\nWest Virginia Route 009",

One reason I think we should keep the Electoral College is the \"certainty of outcome\".  Most of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.  Sometimes, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.  It is hightly unlikely to have a tie with this system also, because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.  Another reason I am in favor of the Electoral College is that no region can get enough electoral votes to elect a president.  A candidate has no reason to campaign in only his or her region alone; they can spend more time in other places instead of relying only on electoral votes.\n I also believe that we should avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.   There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins the majority vote.  The electoral vote declares the winner in that case.  Some people seem to agree that we would be better off without the Electoral College.  They argure that it is \"unfair, outdated, and irrational\".  All in all, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for the United States.  ",

        "text":"The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) was a non-departmental public body jointly sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) in England. It closed on 31 March 2010 and was replaced by the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People's Learning Agency.\n\nHistory\nThe LSC was established in April 2001, under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. It replaced the 72 training and enterprise councils and the Further Education Funding Council for England. In 2006 it had an annual budget of £10.4 billion. It was described as Britain's largest Quango.\n\nUntil June 2007, it was sponsored by the former Department for Education and Skills (DfES).\n\nEconomic mismanagement in college re-building\nIn July 2009, the Public Accounts Committee described the LSC's handling of its college building programme as 'catastrophic mismanagement'. It resulted in a £2.7 billion debt, with 144 college building contracts having to be terminated abruptly, and leaving many colleges with huge financial penalties for breach of contract with civil engineering companies. 23 colleges have debts of more than 40% of their annual income, with some facing possible financial collapse. The re-building programme had renovated over half of England's colleges since 2001.\n\nAbolition\nOn 17 March 2008 the abolition of the LSC was announced; funding responsibilities for 16- to 19-year-old learners were to transfer to Education Funding Agency and the Skills Funding Agency, which was created to distribute funding for adult learners in further education colleges.\n\nThe Machinery of Government announcement heralded the end of the LSC, to make way for the Young Peoples Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency, reporting to DCSF and BIS respectively. These changes started in April 2009 and were completed by March 2010.\n\nMark Haysom's resignation\nMark Haysom CBE, the second chief executive of the LSC, announced that he was stepping down from his role on 23 March 2009 - taking accountability as Chief Executive for difficulties that the LSC had encountered with a college (PFI) rebuilding programme. He was replaced by Geoff Russell, formerly of accountants KPMG.\n\nFunction\nThe LSC was responsible for planning and funding further education (post-16 education and training other than higher education) in England.\n\nInitiatives\n Train to Gain in September 2006\n\nOrganisation\n\nNational office\nThe LSC had a national office in Cheylesmore House, Cheylesmore, Coventry, nine regional offices and 47 local Learning and Skills Council offices.  The LSC's national office was not a typical headquarters – its main role was to produce guidelines and targets for its 47 local offices.\n\nIt was announced in 2005 that the LSC's organisation structure would change as part of the Agenda for Change programme, creating a streamlined configuration with more focus on the regional dimension. Although management and administration has been restructured on regional lines, the 47 local Learning and Skills councils were retained.\n\nRedundancies\nAround 1,300 jobs were lost, 500 from the Coventry headquarters, the remainder from local offices. The restructuring process was challenged by the PCS Union, with a strike that took place on 28 April 2006, and a work-to-rule commencing in May 2006.  The work-to-rule ceased on 26 June 2006 after PCS and LSC representatives reached agreement.\n\nStaff\n\nDuring its lifetime the LSC had three chief executives: John Harwood, Mark Haysom and Geoff Russell.\n\nRegions\nThere were nine regions.\n East of England - Ipswich\n East Midlands - Meridian Business Park (M1\/M69 junction), Leicester\n London - five offices in Stratford (East), Hounslow (West), Croydon (South), Palmers Green (North), and Centre Point on New Oxford Street (Central)\n North East - Team Valley, Gateshead\n North West - Arndale Centre, Manchester\n South East - Brighton and Reading\n South West - Bristol\n West Midlands - Birmingham\n Yorkshire and the Humber - Bradford\n\nCriticism \n\nFormer leader of the CBI, Sir Digby Jones, was critical of the LSC during his time as the UK government's skills envoy.  Speaking of the LSC management and outcomes, he said: \"It is what I call the British Leyland model - you put a lot of money in at the top and an Austin Allegro comes out at the bottom. The money has not been spent in the right way and it is not delivering what the employers want.\"\n\nThere has also been significant press criticism for its handling of EMAs, capital, adult funding and numerous other areas of work especially by its own staff over its handling of various restructures and more recently its closure and transfer of powers to the 2\/3 successor bodies and 150 local authorities.\n\nSimilar organisations\nThe equivalent body in Wales was ELWa. In Scotland, colleges are funded by the Scottish Funding Council.\n\nAlso in England, until 2006, there was the Learning and Skills Development Agency, which split into the Quality Improvement Agency and Learning and Skills Network in March 2006.\n\nSee also\n Education in England\n Higher Education Funding Council for England\n Lifelong learning\n Qualifications and Curriculum Authority\n Vocational education\n Business Link\n National Employer Service (for large companies)\n UK Commission for Employment and Skills\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n Digital Education Resource Archive (DERA) holds an archive of some LSC publications.\n\nNews items\n 11 June 2010 Director of Shropshire LSC jailed after receiving £300,000 in kickbacks from contracts worth £1.3m\n College building £2.7bn in the red in July 2009\n College building is halted in March 2009\n 28 March 2008, LSC: LSC and Carter and Carter\n 13 February 2008, BBC: Anger over pupils database plan\n\nAudio clips\n File on 4 in June 2009 with Gerry Northam\n\nVideo clips\n LSC Yorkshire and Humber\n LSC North East\n TV advert\n Train to Gain TV advert\n\nDefunct non-departmental public bodies of the United Kingdom government\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills\nFurther education colleges in England\nOrganisations based in Coventry\nOrganizations established in 2001\n2010 disestablishments in the United Kingdom\nVocational education in the United Kingdom",

Look to it that you first turn and THEN brake , otherwise the car won't slide. Release the turn when you think it's the right time. start accelerating and shortly turn in the other direction to catch the street grip again.\n\n, It is braking while accelerating. It is the same procedure as the basic slide but don't release the accelerate button. This slide is much longer and of course faster. To use it you don't need to be as fast as in using the basic slide but you will need a considerable amount of speed. It is hard to find the right slide for the right curve, but sooner or later you will get to know what to use where.\n\n, There is not that many curves to do this one, but if there is one, using it would be really helpful. It is a mixture of the Basic AND the power slide. It is not only one Slide. It is a slide consisting of more slides. Start with the power slide and when you need release the brake and go back on it again. The other type of the pulsative slide is the same thing but instead of releasing and pressing the brake button , press the accelerate button. This may sound a bit weird and you will wonder where you have to use it. I can tell you: Nadeo Pro A-1 - The long turn after the second small jump (into the loop parts) you will need a long fast slide to do the first curve and directly afterwards you will need a slow 'n' short one. So you'll start with a powerslide and release the accelerate button when arriving at the harder turn and go back to accelerating after the turn immediately. You will need very very much speed to do this. Important to say is that you can only \"pulsate\" while there are at least 3 braking stripes on the ground visible ( sounds weird, but you'll see)\n\n, It is the small grey stripe that's announcing the borders of a track. If you are too slow to slide but you really want to slide then this slide may help. Drive on the ramstone and start sliding on the ramstone into the track. This one's quite hard because the risk is very high to hit the board when trying it. Not recommended for beginners in rounds mode.\n\n, The intention of this one is to slide when you normally would be too slow to do it. The technique is completely different and you might need a lot of training to handle it. This slide can be done at any speed. The best way to practice it is to build a track that has a 180° turn right at the beginning. Start driving until you reach the turn. Then steer into the turn. Afterwards release the steering key and press the break key (you need to drive straight forward). While you press the break begin steering again. If you did it the right way your car will begin to slide.\n\n, On some U-Turn curves you may arrive too fast and you should brake a really long time to get the curve. So it could be better to hit the board instead of braking and drive through. On some normal curves wallbang is helpful too for example if there's a long curve where you need to slide very much and decreasing lots of speed you could shortly hit the wall and then go full-speed all the way through. Sometimes this is a little bit faster.\n\n, Simply turn just before the jump in the direction you want to slide. It will take some getting used to. Once you master this, try combining this turn with a pulsative or ramstone slide to yield the best results., Try it out and get Pro!\n\n",

Long term, we'll have mixed systems burning natural gas, harvesting wind and solar energy, hydroelectric dams, and nuclear reactors. Combined with storage options that are slowly becoming more practical, power should be able to be supplied around the clock and all year long. This is also the safest option, as a disruption of any one source doesn't crash the electric grid.\n\nLets talk solar panels. The technology has matured quite a bit. Without a doubt, most of the environmental impacts of solar come up early in the process, but those have decreased over the years. As far as lifetime of the solar panel, the industry standard is 1% loss per year, with replacement suggested at the 20 year mark (80% efficiency). \n\nAdditionally, don't forget that solar panels are becoming a standard option in new home construction, and retrofitting an old home to have solar is pretty easy. We've reached a point where the solar panels on the roof of the house are actually producing net positive electric bills for their homes. If you're city allows it, home owners are actually selling electricity back into the grid. Businesses can do the same. Using a building to hold your solar panels is actually pretty efficient, as it cuts down on the number of power plants that have to be built.\n\nSwitching to electric vehicles, yes, it will increase electricity usage, but there's actually an upside to this. Power generated at a plant, even a fossil fuel plant, is more efficient on a pound to pound of CO2 comparison. Your gasoline driven engine is only moderately efficient at turning fossil fuels into power to spin the wheels. Centralizing power generation in big power plants means less CO2 emissions overall, as these are much more efficient engines, and can even be equiped with carbon recapture systems that minimize green house gas emissions.\n\nThe other advantage is that electric cars can pull power from any kind of energy source, like wind, nuclear, solar, or hydro. Instead of driving on 100% fossil fuels, an electric car on the road today is only using about 60% fossil fuel derived energy to get from point A to B, with the remainder coming from green energy sources.\n\nIn conclusion, there are absolutely some technologically mature green energy option ready to go today. We should be phasing them into our power grid as fast as possible, while understanding the reality that we will always use some fossil fuels as backups for power generation.",

        "text":"Dieric Bouts (born c. 1415 – 6 May 1475) was an Early Netherlandish painter. Bouts may have studied under Rogier van der Weyden, and his work was influenced by van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck. He worked in Leuven from 1457 (or possibly earlier) until his death in 1475.\n\nBouts was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point (as illustrated in his Last Supper).\n\nWorks\n\nEarly works (before 1464)\nBouts' earliest work is the Triptych of the Virgin's Life in the Prado (Madrid), dated about 1445. The Deposition Altarpiece in Granada (Capilla Real) probably also dates to this period, around 1450–1460.  A dismembered canvas altarpiece—now in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium (Brussels), the J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles), National Gallery (London), Norton Simon Museum (Pasadena), and a Swiss private collection—with the same dimensions as the Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament may belong to this period.  The Louvre Lamentation (Pietà) is another early work.\n\nDocumented works\n\nThe Last Supper is the central panel of Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament, commissioned from Bouts by the Leuven Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament in 1464. All of the central room's orthogonals (lines imagined to be behind and perpendicular to the picture plane that converge at a vanishing point) lead to a single vanishing point in the centre of the mantelpiece above Christ's head. However the small side room has its own vanishing point, and neither it nor the vanishing point of the main room falls on the horizon of the landscape seen through the windows.  The Last Supper is the second dated work (after Petrus Christus' Virgin and Child Enthroned with St. Jerome and St. Francis in Frankfurt, dated 1457) to display an understanding of Italian linear perspective.\n\nScholars also have noted that Bouts' Last Supper was the first Flemish panel painting to depict the Last Supper. In this central panel, Bouts did not focus on the biblical narrative itself but instead presented Christ in the role of a priest performing the consecration of the Eucharistic host from the Catholic Mass. This contrasts strongly with other Last Supper depictions, which often focused on Judas's betrayal or on Christ's comforting of John. Bouts also added to the complexity of this image by including four servants (two in the window and two standing), all dressed in Flemish attire. Although once identified as the artist himself and his two sons, these servants are most likely portraits of the confraternity's members responsible for commissioning the altarpiece. The Last Supper was the central part of the altarpiece in the St. Peter's Church, Leuven.\n\nThe Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament has four additional panels, two on each side. Because these were taken to the museums in Berlin and Munich in the 19th century, the reconstruction of the original altarpiece has been difficult. Today it is thought that the panel with Abraham and Melchizedek is above the Passover Feast on the left wing, while the Gathering of the Manna is above Elijah and the Angel on the right wing. All of these are typological precursors to the Last Supper in the central panel.\n\nAfter attaining the rank of city painter of Leuven in 1468, Bouts received a commission to paint two more works for the Town Hall. The first was an altarpiece of the Last Judgment (1468–1470), which exists today only in the two wings with the Road to Paradise and The Fall of the Damned in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille (France), and a fragmentary Bust of Christ from the central panel in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm.  After this, he turned to the larger commission for the Justice Panels (1470–1475), which occupied him until his death in 1475. He completed one panel and began a second, both depicting the life of the 11th-century Holy Roman Emperor Otto III. These pieces can now be seen in the Brussels Museum. The remaining two Justice Panels were never completed.\n\nDevotional panels and portraits\n\nMany of Bouts' authentic works are small devotional panels, usually of the Virgin and Child.  An early example is the Davis Madonna in New York (Metropolitan Museum of Art), excellent copies of which exist in the Bargello in Florence and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.  This composition follows the formula of the miraculous icon of Notre-Dame-des-Grâces, which was installed in the cathedral of Cambrai (France) in 1454. The  Virgin and Child in the National Gallery (London) is the largest and most ambitious of these Marian pictures. In the realm of portraiture, Bouts expanded upon the tradition established by Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Petrus Christus.  His dated 1462 Portrait of a Man in the National Gallery (London) is the first instance of a sitter shown in three-quarter view before a discernible background with a glimpse of the landscape out the window. Also widely attributed to Bouts is the Portrait of a Man in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), which resembles some of the figures in the artist's late Justice Panels of 1470–1475. Other portraits associated with Bouts, such as those in Washington (National Gallery of Art) and Antwerp (Royal Museum of Fine Arts), are more problematic.\n\nOther works\n\nThe Last Supper and Justice Panels are the only works known to be definitely done by Bouts.  The remaining panels from the Last Judgment Altarpiece (datable to 1468–1470) and the triptych The Martyrdom of St Erasmus (before 1466) are also fairly secure attributions.  Aside from these, a number of other paintings have been attributed to him.\n\nThese are: Christ in the House of Simon, Christ in the House of Simon and Nativity fragment with the Virgin at Prayer in the Staatliche Museen.  The triptych the Martyrdom of St. Hippolytus (Groeningemuseum), Virgin Enthroned with Four Angels (Capilla Real, Granada), and an Annunciation (Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon). The National Gallery holds [[The Entombment (Bouts)|The Entombment]], the Virgin Enthroned with St. Peter and St. Paul, and The Virgin and Child.  \n\nOthers are Saint James the Greater (Museu de Arte Sacra do Funchal, Madeira, Portugal),  Ecce Agnus Dei, (Alte Pinakothek), Moses before the Burning Bush (Philadelphia Museum of Art), Bust of Christ (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen), Virgin and Child (National Gallery of Art, Washington), and a Resurrection in the Norton Simon Museum of Art. Two are in the Louvre – a Nativity fragment with St. Joseph and the Virgin and Child Enthroned in a Niche.\n\nTwo Boutsian works in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich have perplexed art historians. One is the so-called Pearl of Brabant triptych, which writers as early as 1902 tried to separate from Bouts' authentic works.  Recent research seems to refute this attempt. The other is a pair of panels from an altarpiece depicting the Passion—respectively showing the Betrayal of Christ and the Resurrection. For a long time these were considered some of Bouts' earliest works, but dendrochronological evidence now places them around the time of his death in 1475. Schone's 1938 invention of a \"Master of the Munich Betrayal\" is a more appropriate attribution.\n\nFamily\nBouts was married twice and had four children. One of his weddings was in Leuven about 1447. His two daughters went to convents, and his two sons became painters who carried the Bouts workshop into the mid-16th century. Little is known of the elder son, Dieric the Younger, although he appears to have continued in his father's style until his early death in 1491. The younger brother, Aelbrecht (or Albert), did likewise, but in a style that is unmistakably his own. His distinctive work propelled Boutsian imagery into the 16th century.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nPaul Heiland, Dirk Bouts und die Hauptwerke seiner Schule (Potsdam, 1902).\nMax J.

The\nB-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of\nthe rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on\nthe B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe\nfor large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the\nnon-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary\nthese bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the\nHiggsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of\nnon-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available\nATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search\nchannels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter\nspace. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider\nsensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it\nmay be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small\nor moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.\n",

        "text":"Underground Nuclear Testing is basically burying the bomb very deep underground to help ensure that none of the radioactive fallout goes into the atmosphere. The main idea is environmental protection. There are no special big gigantic underground laboratory structures that the bomb goes off in... it's more or less just a hole in the ground (although generally there are still sensors everywhere to test things).\n\nWhen the bomb goes off, all of the energy is dissipated into the ground around it. The dirt\/rock directly next to the bomb will be vaporized creating a cavity, and a much greater portion of the rock\/dirt will be cracked, crushed, and\/or undergo irreversible changes from stress. Often the top of the ground will be partially blown upwards, and the cavity can collapse forming a crater.\n\nLarge underground explosions, nuclear or otherwise, can be read by seismographs as they are more or less causing earthquakes (although by a completely different method than natural earthquakes) so the 5.1 estimate of North Korea's bomb means it released a similar amount of energy into the surrounding earth that a 5.1 earthquake would have. It's also important to note that data about what happens in North Korea is sketchy, so there is no definite evidence that it was actually a nuclear bomb or something else that North Korea took credit for (like, say, an actual earthquake). However, many other nuclear tests have been detected using seismographs and in some cases they were published as earthquakes by public media first before anyone learned a bomb had gone off.",

        "text":" This is useful because conditional formatting is best understood by testing it on data you already have. While you can apply conditional formatting to empty cells, it is easiest to see if the formatting works by using pre-existing data.;\n, Conditional formatting allows you to change font style, underline, and color. Using conditional formatting, you can also apply strike-through as well as borders and shading to the cells. However, you cannot change the font or the font size of the contents in the cell.\n\n, In Excel 2007 this can be found under \"Home\" > \"Styles\" > \"Conditional Formatting\".\n\n, For this example, two conditions are used to see how each one plays off the other. Excel allows up to three conditions per cell. If you need only one condition, skip the next step.\n\n,,, If it is based on other cells, change the first drop-down to “Formula Is.\" For “Formula Is\" directions, go to the next step. For “Cell Value Is\" directions, do the following:\n\n\nSelect what kind of argument works best using the second drop-down box. For conditions between a low setting and a high setting, select “between\" or “not between.\" For conditions using a single value, use the other arguments. This example will use a single value using the “greater than\" argument.\nDetermine what value(s) should be applied to the argument. For this example, we are using the “greater than\" argument and cell B5 as the value. To select a cell, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.\n\n, After selecting “Formula Is,\" all the drop-downs disappear and you are left with a text field. This means you can type in any formula you want using Excel’s formulas. For the most part, you want to stick to simple formulas and avoid text or text strings. Keep in mind that the formula is based on the current cell. For an example, think like this: C5 (current cell) = B5>=B6. This means that C5 will change formatting when B5 is greater than or equal to B6. This example can actually be used in “Cell Value Is,\" but you get the idea. To select a cell in the worksheet, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.\n\n\nFor example: Imagine you have a spreadsheet with all the days of the current month listed down in Column A; you need to enter data in this worksheet everyday; and you would like the entire row associated with today's date to light up in some way. Try this: (1) Highlight your entire table of data, (2) Select conditional formatting as explained above, (3) Select \"Formula Is\" and (4) Enter something like =$A3=TODAY() where Column A contains your dates and Row 3 is your first row of data (after your headings). Note that you want the dollar sign in front of the A but not in front of the 3. (5) Select your formats. , You will notice that it automatically places dollar signs ($) before the row and column designations. This makes that cell reference non-transferable. This means if you were to apply the same conditional formatting to other cells through copy\/paste, they will all reference the original cell. To turn this off, simply click in the text field and delete the dollar signs. If you do not want to set a condition using a cell in your sheet, simply type the value into the text field. You can even enter text, depending on the arguments. For example, don’t use “greater than\" as the argument and “John Smith\" in the text field. You can’t be greater than John Smith...well, you could, but - oh, never mind. In this example, the whole condition, if you were going to say it out loud, would read something like this: “When this cell’s value is greater than the value in cell B5, then...\"\n\n, Keep in mind that you want to offset the cell from the rest of the sheet, especially if you have lots of data. But you also want to make it look professional. For this example, we want the font to become bold and white and the shading to become red. To begin, click “Format...\"\n\n, Then click “Border\" and make any changes there. This example does not make border changes. Then click “Patterns\" and make changes there. At whatever point you are finished making the formatting changes, click \"OK.\"\n\n, Make changes as needed until the formatting appears the way you would like.\n\n, You will notice in the example that the second condition also includes a small formula (=B5*.90). This takes the value of B5, multiplies it by 0.9 (aka 90 percent) and applies formatting if the value is less than that.\n\n, One of two things will happen:\n\n\nNo changes will appear. This means that the conditions are not met, so no formatting was applied.\nOne of the formats you selected appears because one of the conditions has been met.\n\n",

        "text":"The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity – self-designation ENISA from the abbreviation of its original name – is an agency of the European Union. It is fully operational since September 1, 2005. The Agency is located in Athens, Greece and has a second office in Heraklion, Greece.            \n\nENISA was created in 2004 by EU Regulation No 460\/2004 under the name of European Network and Information Security Agency. ENISA's Regulation is the EU Regulation No 2019\/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing EU Regulation No 526\/2013 (Cybersecurity Act).  The Agency works closely together with the EU Member States and other stakeholders to deliver advice and solutions as well as improving their cybersecurity capabilities. It also supports the development of a cooperative response to large-scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents or crises and since 2019, it has been drawing up cybersecurity certification schemes.\n\nENISA assists the Commission, the member states and, consequently, the business community in meeting the requirements of network and information security, including present and future EU legislation. ENISA ultimately strives to serve as a centre of expertise for both member states and EU Institutions to seek advice on matters related to network and information security.\n\nENISA has been supporting the organization of the \"Cyber Europe\" pan-European cybersecurity exercises since 2010.\n\nOrganisation \nENISA is managed by the executive director and supported by a staff composed of experts representing stakeholders such as the information and communication technologies industry, consumer groups and academic experts. The agency is overseen by the executive board and the management board, which are composed of representatives from the EU member states, the EU Commission and other stakeholders. \n\nSet up in 2004 as an informal point of reference into the member states, as of 27 June 2019 the National Liaison Officers network has become a statutory body of ENISA. The National Liaison Officers Network facilitates the exchange of information between ENISA and the member states. The agency is also assisted by the Advisory Group which is composed of “nominated members” and members appointed “ad personam”, all in total 33 members from all over Europe. The advisory group focuses on issues relevant to stakeholders and brings them to the attention of ENISA.\n\nIn order to carry out its tasks, the agency has a budget of nearly €17 million for the year 2019 and 70 statutory staff members. In addition, the agency employs a number of other employees including seconded national experts, trainees and interim agents. There are plans for additional experts to be integrated into the agency following the entering into force of Regulation 2019\/881.\n\nHistory \nIn 2007, European Commissioner Viviane Reding proposed that ENISA be folded into a new European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA). By 2010, Commissioner Neelie Kroes signalled that the European Commission wanted a reinforced agency. The agency mandate was extended up to 2012 with an annual budget of €8 million, under the leadership of Dr. Udo Helmbrecht. The last extension of ENISA's mandate before it became permanent was done by the EU Regulation 526\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013, repealing Regulation (EC) 460\/2004. As of 27 June 2019, ENISA has been established for an indefinite period.\n\nENISA headquarters, including its administration and support functions, were originally based in Heraklion, Greece. The choice of a rather remote site was contentious from the outset, particularly since Greece held the EU Council presidency when the agency’s mandate was being negotiated. In addition, the agency has had a liaison office in Athens since October 2009. In 2013, it moved one-third of its staff of then sixty from Crete to Athens. In 2016, the Committee on Budgets backed ENISA’s bid to shut down the Heraklion office. Since 2019, ENISA has two offices; Its headquarters in Athens and a second office in Heraklion, Greece. In June 2021, the European Commission gave their consent to the establishment of an ENISA office in Brussels.\n\nExecutive director \n 2004 - October 2009 : Mr Andrea Pirotti (an Italian national and former Vice-President of Marconi Communications)\n October 2009 – October 2019 : Dr Udo Helmbrecht (a German national and former president\/director of the Federal Office for Information Security Germany)\n since October 2019: Juhan Lepassaar (Estonia)\n\nSee also\n EUDRANET\n European Cybercrime Centre\n Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)\n\nReferences\n\nHow the European Union works\n\nExternal links\n\nAgencies of the European Union\n2005 establishments in Greece\n2005 in the European Union\nGovernment agencies established in 2005\nHeraklion\nInformation technology organizations based in Europe\nOrganizations based in Crete\nNational cyber security centres",

Your children will definitely have a higher chance of inheriting the chance to develop diabetes.\n\nAs for diabetes itself, it's a collection of sometimes unrelated conditions which result in the body not being able to properly regulate blood sugar levels.  Like cancer, it's not all one disease and there's no one cure.  Diabetes is more the result than the cause.  Common ways the body doesn't work right resulting in diabetes include 1) not producing the right amount of insulin, 2) not properly using the insulin, 3) the liver not properly absorbing\/releasing sugar (short term), 4) the body not properly storing\/releasing sugar in the form of fat (long term), and 5) the fifth one that I always forget when making these lists.\n\nBeing overweight does *not* inevitably lead to diabetes.  If you have the genetic propensity for diabetes, and it's one of the types that is made worse by being overweight, then being overweight may cause your diabetes to manifest earlier or be more difficult to control.  There are plenty of good reasons to maintain a healthy weight, but diabetes isn't one of them.  Research says that about 25% of diabetics were not overweight at the time of their diagnosis, and about 75% of overweight people in the general population will never develop diabetes.  (I was just three (3) pounds over my ideal weight when diagnosed with Type 2, so 20 years of people telling me I did this to myself by being obese has left me a little overly sensitive to the subject.)",

        "text":"Lego Mindstorms (sometimes stylized as LEGO MINDSTORMS) was a hardware and software structure which develops programmable robots based on Lego building blocks. Each version includes computer Lego bricks, a set of modular sensors and motors, and parts from the Lego Technic line to create the mechanical systems. The system is controlled by the Lego bricks which act as the brain of the mechanical system.\n\nWhile originally conceptualized and launched as a tool to support educational constructivism, Mindstorms has become the first home robotics kit available to a wide audience. It has developed a community of adult hobbyists and hackers as well as students and general lego enthusiasts following the product's launch in 1998. In October 2022, The Lego Group announced Lego Mindstorms will be discontinued at the end of 2022.\n\nPre-Mindstorms\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1985, Seymour Papert, Mitchel Resnick and Stephen Ocko created a company called Microworlds with the intent of developing a construction kit that could be animated by computers for educational purposes. Papert had previously created the Logo programming language as a tool to \"support the development of new ways of thinking and learning\", and employed \"Turtle\" robots to physically act out the programs in the real world. As the types of programs created were limited by the shape of the Turtle, the idea came up to make a construction kit that could use Logo commands to animate a creation of the learner's own design. Similar to the \"floor turtle\" robots used to demonstrate Logo commands in the real world, a construction system that ran Logo commands would also demonstrate them in the real world, but allowing the child to construct their own creations benefitted the learning experience by putting them in control  In considering which construction system to partner with, they wanted a \"low floor high ceiling\" approach, something that was easy to pick up but very powerful. To this end, they decided to use Lego bricks due to the system and diversity of pieces, and the Logo language due to the groups familiarity with the software and its ease of use. Lego was receptive to collaboration, particularly because its educational division had founding goals very similar to those of the Microworlds company. The collaboration very quickly moved to the newly minted MIT Media lab, where there was an open sharing of ideas. As a sponsor of the entire lab, Lego was allowed royalty free rights to mass-produce any technology produced by Papert, Resnick and Ocko's group; and was also allowed to send an employee over to assist with research, so they sent engineer Alan Tofte (also spelled Toft) who helped with the design of the programmable brick. As another part of the MIT Media Lab was community outreach, so the bricks would be used working with children in schools for both research and educational purposes.\n\nLego\/Logo, lego tc Logo (1985)\n\nThe first experiments of combining Lego and the Logo programming language was called Lego\/Logo and it started in 1985. Similar to the \"floor turtles\" used to demonstrate Logo commands in the real world, Lego\/Logo used Logo commands to animate Lego creations. It is important that children could build their own machines to program, as they would then care more about their projects and be more willing to explore the mathematical concepts involved in making them move. The Lego\/Logo system allowed children to create their own designs and experiments, offered multiple paths for learning and encouraged a sense of community. First, machines are built out Lego. The machines are then connected to a computer and programmed in a modified version of Logo. The Lego\/Logo system introduced new types of parts for making creations such as: motors, sensors and lights. The motors and sensors are connected to an interface box which is communicates with a computer. Lego\/Logo would later be commercialized by the Lego group Lego tc Logo. It was observed that using the Lego\/Logo system, children developed a form of knowledge about the physical world that allowed those even without mathematics or verbal skills to solve problems effectively using the system.\n\nLogo Brick 1st Generation, \"Grey Brick\" (1986)\n\nWhile Lego\/Logo was powerful, it was restricted somewhat by the requirement to have the creations attached to a computer. The group began working on further iterations of the Lego\/Logo environment to produce a robot that could interact not only with the environment but with other robots programmed in the same system.\nThe experiments with an untethered brick (called the Logo Brick or \"Grey Brick\") began in the fall of 1986. To speed up the design process, the Logo Brick contained the processor chip from an Apple II computer. It ran an adapted version of Lego\/Logo written for the Apple II computer. The Lego\/Logo interface box, The previous development of the group, had only two sensor ports available, which the design team observed were not always enough. To address this, they gave the Logo Brick four sensor ports. The Logo Brick was made out of a modified Lego battery box and was about the size of a deck of cards. The Logo Brick was tested in schools.\n\nLego Mindstorms and RCX (1996)\n\nDevelopment\nWhile Lego had been interested in mass-producing the programmable brick concept for a while, they had to wait until enough people owned personal computers and the components required to produce the intelligent brick went down in price. Development of what would later be known as Lego Mindstorms started in 1996 as the first product of the newly created home-learning division of Lego Education (Lego Dacta). The product's name of \"Mindstorms\" was intended to express the user experience of the product, it is named after Papert's book Mindstorms, as the user experience was similar to the educational constructivism concepts described in his book. The Lego home education team used the insights that MIT researchers discovered from testing the 3rd Generation Logo Brick (\"Red Brick\") in schools as the basis for the development of the mass-produced programmable brick. The physical programmable brick was re-engineered from the ground up, as the experimental programmable bricks were not designed for robustness or cost-effective manufacturing. The programming language of the product was developed with help from members of the MIT Media lab. Lego decided to use a Visual programming language for Mindstorms, inspired by the LOGOBlocks language previously used with programmable brick experiments, in order to make the product accessible to children who might be unfamiliar with programming. While the technology that Mindstorms was based on was aimed towards \"all children\", the chosen target demographic of Lego Mindstorms was intentionally narrow, in order to garner positive press by outselling expectations. The decision was made to aim the product towards 10 to 14-year-old boys, partly because it was Lego's main target demographic, and partly based on market research (not substantiated by the findings of the MIT Media Lab) which concluded that this demographic would be most attracted to computerized toys. This choice of target demographic directly informed the color of the RCX brick (which was made yellow and black to resemble construction equipment) and the sample uses for the Mindstorms kit (such as making autonomous robots).\n\nThe project's at-first low profile allowed the Mindstorms team the freedom to develop the product using operating procedures then-unorthodox to the Lego Group. Unlike traditional Lego sets, the Mindstorms Robotics Invention System did not have a main model, nor was the play driven by storytelling.  To bridge the gap between this new play experience and pre-existing Lego ones, the Mindstorms team created a lot of opportunities for people interested in the product to engage with each other, such as the creation of Mindstorms.com, Mindstorms Discovery Centers, and the FIRST Lego League. The creation of these experiences was done through partnerships with a relatively large amount of external groups that the Mindstorms team interacted with as equal partners, something that was uncommon for the Lego group at the time. To ease tensions between Mindstorms and more conventional products, the project team was given autonomy from Lego's product development process and instead reported directly to the company's senior management.\n\nPromotion of the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System began 6 months before the product was planned to launch. The product was first soft launched with the opening of the Mindstorms Discovery Center at the Museum of Science and Industry, where children could interact with the Mindstorms Robotics Invention System to complete set tasks, getting them familiar with the product. The Mindstorms product was launched concurrently with Lego Cybermaster, another Lego product spun off from the MIT programmable brick technology that was more in line with the traditional product philosophies of the Lego group.\n\nInstead of being sold at toy stores, the product was sold at electronics stores like BestBuy and CompUSA, due to the relatively high cost of the set.\n\nLaunch\nLego Mindstorms was released on 1 September 1998 at a retail price of $199. The entire production run (of between 60 and 100 thousand units) sold out within 3 months. Despite being aimed towards children, the kit quickly found an audience with adults and hackers of all ages; Lego company surveys had determined that seventy percent of Lego Mindstorms Hobbyists were adults. Shortly following the product's launch, hobbyists began sharing reverse-engineered versions of the RCX brick's Microcode and Firmware on the internet, leading to the development of alternative programming languages for the RCX such as \"Not Quite C\" (NQC) and alternative operating systems for the brick like legOS. The Lego Group was surprised by the products embrace by adult hobbyists, and was not sure how to respond to the sharing of proprietary code. The Mindstorms team would determine that the embrace of the product by the hacking community proved that the product was worth developing; In order to foster this burgeoning community, an official forum was established on the Lego website and a \"right to hack\" clause was added to end user license agreement of the Lego Mindstorms software.\n\nRobotics Discovery Set and Droid, Dark Side Developer Kit\nThe Robotics Discovery Set was a more affordable and simpler package than the Robotics Invention Set. Instead of being based on the RCX, it had its own programmable brick called the Scout. An even simpler version of the Scout would be featured in two Star-Wars-themed Mindstorm sets.\n\nScout\nLego also released a blue computer called the Scout, which has 2 sensor ports, 2 motor ports (plus one extra if linked with a Micro Scout using a fiber optic cable), and a built-in light sensor, but no PC interface. It comes with the Robotics Discovery Set. The Scout can be programmed from a collection of built-in program combinations. In order to program the Scout, a user must enable \"power mode\" on it. The Scout can store one program.\n\nThe Scout is based on a Toshiba microcontroller with 32 KB of ROM and 1 KB of RAM, where about 400 bytes are available for user programs. Due to the extremely limited amount of RAM, many predefined subroutines were provided in ROM. The Scout only supports passive external sensors, which means that only touch, temperature and other unpowered sensors can be used. The analog-to-digital converters used in the Scout only have a resolution of 8 bits, in contrast to the 10-bit converters of the RCX.\n\nThere was a plan for Lego to create a booster set that allows programming the Scout from a computer with software such as RCX code. However, due to the complexity of this project, it was abandoned.\n\nThe RCX can control the Scout brick using the \"Send IR Message\" program block. The RCX does all of the controlling, and therefore can be programmed with the PC, while the Scout accepts commands. The Scout brick must have all of its options set to \"off\" during this process.\n\nMicro Scout\nThe Micro Scout was added as an entry-level to Lego robotics. It is a very limited Pbrick with a single built-in light sensor and a single built-in motor. It has seven built-in programs and can be controlled by a Scout, Spybotics or RCX unit using VLL. Like the Scout, the Micro Scout is also based on a microcontroller from Toshiba.\n\nThe unit was sold as part of the Droid Developer Kit (featuring R2-D2) and later the Dark Side Developer Kit (featuring an AT-AT Imperial Walker).\n\nRobotics Invention System\nThe main core of the first generation of Mindstorms sets were the Robotics Invention System sets. These were based around the RCX (Robotic Command eXplorers) brick and the 9 V Lego Technic peripherals available at the time. It also includes three touch-sensors and an optical sensor, using the technology from the earlier 9 V sensors from the pre-Mindstorms sets.\n\nRCX\n \nThe RCX is based on the 8-bit Renesas H8\/300 microcontroller, including 32 KB of ROM for low-level IO functions, along with 32 KB of RAM to store high-level firmware and user programs. The RCX is programmed by uploading a program using a dedicated infrared interface. After the user uploads a program, the RCX can run it on its own without the need for computer access. Programs may make use of three sensor input ports and three 9 V output ports, in addition to the IR interface, enabling several RCX bricks to communicate. A built-in LCD can display the battery level, the status of the input\/output ports, which program is selected or running, and other information.\n\nVersion 1.0 RCX bricks feature a power adapter jack in addition to batteries. In version 2.0 (as well as later 1.0s included in the RIS 1.5), the power adapter jack was removed. Power adapter-equipped RCX bricks were popular for stationary robotics projects (such as robot arms) or for controlling Lego model trains. In the latter context, the RCX might be programmed with Digital Command Control (DCC) software to operate multiple wired trains.\n\nThe IR interface on the RCX is able to communicate with Spybots, Scout Bricks, Lego Trains, and the NXT (using a third-party infrared link sensor). The RCX 1.0 IR receiver carrier frequency is 38.5 kHz, while the RCX 2.0 IR carrier frequency is 76 kHz. Both versions can transmit on either frequency. The RCX communicates with a computer using a Serial or USB IR tower. As the RCX is discontinued, support for the interface is limited on more recent operating systems than Windows XP.\n\nAll RCX versions have a unique number printed on them, which could be registered on the now-defunct Lego Mindstorms RCX website. This was necessary to obtain technical support. The first RCX produced is marked \"000001,\" and was on display at the Mindstorms 10th Anniversary event.\n\nThe Lego RCX was available in new sets from 1998 (Lego Set 9719: Robotics Invention System 1.0) through 2003 (Lego Set 9786: Robo Technology Set, with USB cable). The original RCX 1.0 worked with existing Lego power supply products from the Lego Train theme, Lego Product 70931: Electric Train Speed Regulator 9V Power Adaptor for 120v 60 Hz - US version (Years: 1991 thru 2004), Lego Product 70938: Electric Train Speed Regulator 9V Power Adaptor for 230v 50 Hz - European version (Years: 1991 thru 1996). Both of these products converted wall power to 12VAC, through a coaxial power connector (also called a \"barrel connector\"), 5.5 mm outside, 2.1 mm inside. These were sometimes sold alone and sometimes available as part of other sets such as Lego Set 4563: Load N' Haul Railroad (Year: 1991) and Lego Set 10132: Motorized Hogwarts Express (Year: 2004).\n\nLego Mindstorms NXT\n\nLego Mindstorms NXT was a programmable robotics kit released by Lego in August 2006, replacing the first-generation Lego Mindstorms kit.\nThe kit consists of 577 pieces, including: 3 servo motors, 4 sensors (ultrasonic, sound, touch, and light), 7 connection cables, a USB interface cable, and the NXT Intelligent Brick. The Intelligent Brick is the \"brain\" of a Mindstorms machine. It lets the robot autonomously perform different operations. The kit also includes NXT-G, a graphical programming environment that enables the creation and downloading of programs to the NXT. The software also has instructions for 4 robots: Alpha-Rex (a humanoid), Tri-Bot (a car), Robo-Arm T-56 (a robotic arm), and Spike (a scorpion)\n\nLego Mindstorms NXT 2.0\n\nThe Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 was launched on 5 August 2009. It contains 619 pieces (includes sensors and motors), two Touch Sensors, an Ultrasonic Sensor, and introduced a new Color Sensor. The NXT 2.0 uses Floating Point operations whereas earlier versions use Integer operation. The kit costs around US$280.\n\nLego Mindstorms EV3\n\nThe Lego Mindstorms EV3 is the third generation Lego Mindstorms product. EV3 is a further development of the NXT. The system was released on 1 September 2013. The Lego Mindstorms EV3 set includes motors (2 large servo motor and 1 medium servo motor), sensors (2 touch sensors, ultrasonic sensor, color sensor, infrared sensor, and the new gyro sensor), the EV3 programmable brick, 550+ Lego Technic elements and a remote control (the Infrared Beacon, which is only on Home\/Retail mode). The EV3 can be controlled by smart-devices. It can boot an alternative operating system from a microSD card, which makes it possible to run ev3dev, a Debian-based operating system.\n\nLego Education Spike Prime\n\nSpike Prime was announced in April 2019. While not being part of the Mindstorms product line, the basic set includes three motors (1 large 2 medium) and sensors for distance, force and color a controller brick based on an STM32F413 microcontroller and 520+ Lego Technic elements.\n\nLego Mindstorms Robot Inventor\nLego Mindstorms Robot Inventor was announced in June 2020 and released later in autumn. It has four medium motors from Spike Prime, two sensors (distance sensor and color\/light sensor) also from Spike Prime, a Spike Prime hub with a six-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer, and support for controllers and phone control. It also has 902+ Lego Technic elements.\n\nProgramming languages\n\nUse in education \nMindstorms kits are also sold and used as an educational tool, originally through a partnership between Lego and the MIT Media Laboratory. The educational version of the products is called Mindstorms for Schools or Mindstorms Education, and later versions come with the ROBOLAB GUI-based programming software, developed at Tufts University using the National Instruments LabVIEW as an engine.\n\nSee also\n FIRST Lego League\n World Robot Olympiad (WRO)\n Robofest\n FIRST Tech Challenge\n RoboCup Junior\n Lego Education (WeDo 2.0)\n Big Trak\n iRobot Create\n Robotis Bioloid\n The Robotic Workshop\n Robotics suite\n C-STEM Studio\n Botball\n CubeStormer II\n Cubestormer 3\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Bagnall, Brian.
