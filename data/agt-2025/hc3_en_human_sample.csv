Heterosexual sex using protection and common STDs Please explain like I'm five.,"There are several factors involved in this , such as the STD in question , the method of sex , if the giver or receiver is the one infected , whether the sex in question is heterosexual or homosexual and the genders of the participants if homosexual , if there 's any open sores or wounds , even if the guy is circumcised or not . For example , with anal sex , if the "" top "" is HIV negative and the "" bottom "" is HIV positive , the top has about a 0.11 percent chance of contracting HIV from a single encounter , which goes up to 0.62 percent if he is circumcised .

13542,About those giant methane bubbles in the arctic that could cause a new mass extinction . Why do n't they just light it on fire and burn it all away ? I mean obviously they ca n't or they would but I do n't get why . Please explain like I'm five.,"I 'm going to assume you mean the methane trapped in the tundra and not the methane hydrate found on the sea floor . The short answer is that yes they absolutely could drill wells and begin capturing the methane as the permafrost warms . The economics however are very unclear . This option would almost certainly be very expensive . Given the soil conditions in the arctic and the diffused nature of the methane this would probably be like trying to suck a thick milkshake through a straw . Basically the methane is spread out over a massive area instead of being concentrated like an oil field . If the arctic warms enough that methane will begin leaking out everywhere at once causing a runaway greenhouse effect . Burning it whenever possible would reduce the effect , but setting fire to the entire arctic circle seems unreasonable .",0,reddit_eli5

13804,"Do blank CD 's , VHS Tape 's , Mini Disc 's etc weigh less than when they are filled with data ? Was wondering , could not find a scientific answer . Please explain like I'm five.","No . Data is not a physical "" thing "" . Data is when you take an existing medium and rearrange parts of it in a way that represents some sort of information . For instance , for magnetic storage ( VHS and non - SSD hard drives ) , the data is stored as the specific alignment of magnetic domains on the tape / platter . The magnetic fields are * always there * , and you just change which way they 're pointing to represent different data . If you want to go to the simplest possible example , a light switch can be thought of as a one - bit data storage device . It 's either off or on , which is one bit of information ( 0 or 1 ) . But the switch does n't weigh more which you flip it from off to on ( or vice verse ) .",0,reddit_eli5

Please explain like I'm five.","There are algorithms to draw districts in a unbiased way . The shortest - splitline is a good one . ShortestSplitLine ( State , N ) { If N=1 then output entire state as the district ; A = floor(N/2 ) ; B = ceiling(N/2 ) ; find shortest splitline resulting in A : B pop ratio ( breaking ties , if any , as described in notes ) ; Use it to split the state into the two HemiStates SA and SB ; ShortestSplitLine ( SB , B ) ; ShortestSplitLine ( SA , A ) ; } --- Notes : 1 . Since the Earth is round , when we say "" line "" we more precisely mean "" great circle . "" If there is an exact length - tie for "" shortest "" then break that tie by using the line closest to North - South orientation , and if it 's still a tie , then use the Westernmost of the tied dividing lines . 2 . If the state is convex , then a line will always split it into exactly two pieces ( each itself convex ) . However , for nonconvex states , a line could split it into more than two connected pieces e.g. by "" cutting off several bumps . "" ( We expect that will occur rarely , but it is certainly mathematically possible . ) In either case the splitline 's "" length "" is distance between the two furthest - apart points of the line that both lie within the region being split . 3 . If anybody 's residence is split in two by one of the splitlines ( which would happen , albeit very rarely ) then they are automatically declared to lie in the most - western ( or if line is EW , then northern ) of the two districts .

2106,"Why is internet speed measured in megabits per second , whereas file sizes are measured in megabytes . edit : A ton of great comments and explanations . Thanks a lot guys ! Explain like I'm five.","Despite what everyone else is saying about it being "" Oh , corporate < YOURCOUNTRYHERE > is trying to fuck you over , "" it 's actually because a bit of information was much more important than eight of them back when modems were measured in baud ( well , I guess they technically still are ) . A bit would be represented as a pulse of electricity or a lack of a pulse of electricity . A byte in this context is stupid to refer to ( at least according to people in networking ) . Originally , modems went only 300 bits per second . It was really important to know it could send 300 pulses in a second , rather than 37 and a half bytes per second . As modems got faster , nobody dared change from bits to bytes , fearing that , yes , the consumer would be too stupid and think a slower modem was a faster one . The convention stems from that and I 'd consider it a pretty sound convention , although I also think that a lot of people need to learn the difference between a byte and a bit .",0,reddit_eli5

15413,"Reddit ( Warning : Meta ! ) Really , how can someone explain reddit ? I 've ineffectively explained reddit time and time again to curious friends , so how do I do it ? Explain like I'm five.","Reddit is a discussion forum and a link - sharing website . A person can submit links to other webpages or submit their own topic for discussion ( a "" self - post "" ) . Others can comment on the link or the self - post , and decide its popularity by "" up""voting or "" down""voting these links ( similar to Facebook 's "" Like "" and the non - existent "" Dislike "" ) . When reddit started , there were several other "" social bookmarking "" websites . Apart from the concept of "" self - posts "" and a simple interface , what made reddit unique was the concept of "" subreddits "" ( or simply "" reddits "" ) . Essentially , each subreddit is a section dedicated to a particular area of interest . Reddit users can create their own own subreddits , and create rules for it . A subreddit appealing to a specific niche tends to attract people with similar interests , allowing creation of online "" communities "" . For example , the collective mindset of the people in the "" islam "" subreddit is very different from that of the people in the "" atheism "" subreddit . While most similar message boards became "" ghettos "" attracting only a certain type of crowd , reddit could attract a relatively diverse crowd , allowing it to become more popular ( Only a subreddit , not the whole site , would be a "" ghetto "" here ) . That said , the average redditor is libertarian , non - religious and slightly geeky . The most highly upvoted stories from different subreddits appear on the site 's front page . Registered users can subscribe or unsubscribe to the various subreddits . The stories on their personalized front page will change accordingly . So , if you are a pet - loving person from Toronto who likes soccer and movies , you can subscribe to these subreddits : pets , Toronto , soccer and movies .",0,reddit_eli5

14837,Why having one world currency would be a bad thing Intrigued as to why people do n't like the idea . Explain like I'm five.,"I think that most people believe that this would be a pretty simple solution , when actually , it involves one of the most complex macroeconomic concepts the modern world has seen . ( Now , I do n't know how well you know supply and demand , but since this is ELI5 , I 'll make it simple . ) Basically , this meant that international exchange rates * depend * on the exchange of gold . This implied that countries could not really control their exchange rates . The only option they had was to buy or sell gold depending on the circumstance , appreciating or depreciating the currency . Now , this is n't the most efficient way of doing things , and policy - makers began to see this . The gold system meant that governments had little control over recessions , other than fiscal stimulus ( raising government spending ) . Halfway through the 20th century , leaders of the most powerful nations in the world decided on ending the Bretton - Woods system . The end of the Bretton - Woods system removed gold from the currency . This completely changed macroeconomics . * Let 's describe this in a little bit more detail . We 'll take the US as an example . The dollar is no longer tied to the price of gold . Now , supply and demand decide the US dollar . Basically , if more people demand US goods , the dollar becomes stronger ( since more people want US goods , they must use dollars to get them , so demand for the currency goes up , appreciating the currency ) , and we , as Americans , can buy more goods with it . Same works for the reverse . If less people want American goods , they demand less of our currency , and the US dollar depreciates . * * I know this is getting long , but stay with me ! Let 's say we 're in a recession . The US can purposely * depreciate its currency . * Why would it do this ? Well if the currency depreciates , more people can buy more of our stuff because it 's less expensive ( since our currency is cheaper to them ) . How does the government do this ? Well , it can simply supply more dollars to the world , which lowers the price of dollars . If the government does this , other countries suddenly want our goods , so our recession disappears more quickly . This is called monetary policy . * * PHEW . Last part . * * Now , what happens if we tie our currency to everyone else 's currency ? Well , we suddenly lose that power . This is why the Euro is in such bad shape . Greece is in a bad situation , and normally , they could just depreciate its currency and that would help with the recession , but now , it 's tied to the Euro ! Greece can not depreciate the Euro because the currency is controlled by the European Union . And the European Union does not want to depreciate the currency because this weakens other members of the EU , since it makes their currency less valuable and they can buy less things from the US and the rest of the world . As you can see , this means bad news bears . Members of the European Union are now incredibly frustrated with Greece ! And why would n't they be ? Their wellbeing is tied to Greece 's wellbeing . We can apply this to a world currency now . Let 's say Japan goes through a recession . Well , the US is doing well ! Why would the US want to devalue its currency just to help Japan ? Monetary policy has become a very valuable tool for policy - makers , so taking that away would erase nearly a century of economic theory . EDIT : I now see how long this is . Sorry ! But I hope it 's helpful , haha . EDIT2 : All of you bringing up the Bretton - Woods system are right . The * end * of the Bretton - Woods system brought about fiat currency . Thanks for the correction !",0,reddit_eli5

8470,programming languages . How are they made ? Why are they different?How is one more powerful than another ? Explain like I'm five.,"Usually you write a book or report describing how the rules should be used , giving examples , and generally clarifying the intentions of various rules . Programming language rules are similar to English language rules . For instance , you may know of the rule "" i before e , except after c "" . This rule tells you something about how you are supposed to spell words in the English language . Computer language rules are similar , for example in the C programming language you must end each programming statement with a semicolon . Programming rules are enforced much more strictly than English language rules . For instance , if you write "" recieve "" instead of "" receive "" , most people who read "" recieve "" will be able to understand what you mean . Not so with computer languages . Computer languages are designed to be read by a special computer program called a compiler ( some computer languages are read by an interpreter instead , but the rules still apply ) . BAM ! Error ! Can not continue ! The reason that the rules of computer languages are enforced much more strictly is because the compiler needs to understand * exactly * and * precisely * what you are trying to tell it . Being not as smart as a human being , the compiler relies heavily on the application of language rules to understand what it needs to understand . If you leave out the semicolon , the compiler does not know where one statement ends and the next one begins , though it might seem obvious to you and me . There are many different computer languages , as you have noted . The reason is that depending on the set of rules that make up a particular language , it may be more easy for a human being to program certain tasks in one language than in another . You can compare it to the argot used by humans when they talk about their job . A brain surgeon will explain an open cranium operation using quite different terms and concepts than a rocket scientists describing the equilibrium of a Lagrange point . In general you might say there is at least one computer language tailored to meet the needs of almost any task that you want a computer to perform . When there are several languages designed to do the same job , it usually depends on personal preferences which of the languages willbe used in a specific situation . The more general purpose computer languages such as C , Java , Basic , Python and a coupe more are all more or less equally good ( or bad ) at what they were designed to do . Again , using one instead of the other is usually decided largely by circumstance and preference .",0,reddit_eli5
15323,How spiral arms form in galaxies Should n't it be like stirring hot chocolate powder in a cup ? Explain like I'm five.,"The speed of rotation of a galaxy is a bit weird to say the least . The speed increases until the middle of the disc ( i m talking about the radius of the galaxy , not the diameter ) . From the middle of the radius to the centre of the galaxy , speed again decreases . So what you have here is bits of matter ( gas , dust , planetary systems etc ) and stars which are held loosely together due to gravity . The matter bunched up into arms , due to the arrangement of the galactic magnetic fields . Due to the uneven rotation speed , the middle of these structures gets "" smeared "" all over the place , as the faster middle overtakes the slow centre and the edge . ps : Its a good thing we are living in a spiral galaxy , the other kinds of galaxies have virtually no heavy elements , hence , chances of intelligent life or even , higher forms of life is almost zero .",0,reddit_eli5

8684,What exactly is a nuclear bomb ? What goes on inside ? Explain like I'm five.,"Well there are two things you could be asking , how a nuclear reaction takes place , and what physically happens inside the bomb to make it go off . For the sake of simplicity I 'm going to talk about the only two bombs ever used in anger , the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs used on Japan in WWII . Both of these bombs use a process known as Fission , which literally mean the splitting of something into two parts . In this case what we are splitting are atoms . An atom , in the most basic sense is made up of a nucleus , and electrons that orbit it , sort of the same way moons orbit planets ( [ here is a picture for reference ] ( URL_1 ) ) . The goal of a fission reaction is to cause the nucleus to become unstable and break apart which releases the electrons from their orbits to shoot off in all different directions . This is in essence what any explosion is , a very rapid uncontrolled release of electrons . * * So how do they do that ? * * First you need to pick the right atom to split . Some elements are too stable , and others do n't have enough electrons to make the reaction worthwhile . There are 4 different materials you can use to create a fission reaction ; two types of uranium , and two types of plutonium . The most common way to do this is to hit the nucleus with neutrons ( one of the two materials that make up the nucleus of an atom ) . This causes the nucleus to become unstable and break apart releasing all the electrons . * * So what happens to all those bits of flying atoms ? * * Once a fission reaction has started all the electrons that are released take the form of visible light , heat , and movement ( aka an explosion ) . The neutrons that go shooting off are actually the most important part in all this . They start hitting other atoms of the uranium / plutonium and start triggering more reactions , which is why fission is sometimes called a chain reaction . The more atoms you break apart the more neutrons you release , and the more neutrons you release the more atoms you can break apart . Because there can be billions and billions of atoms in a single piece of uranium / plutonium the amount of energy released from a reaction like this is staggering . By comparison , 10 kg ( 22lbs ) of dynamite can maybe blow up a small building , 10 kg of plutonium can destroy a city of a quarter of a million people . * * So how do they fit all this into a bomb ? * * What 's quite interesting about the bombs used in WWII is how different they are , they use different fuels , and different triggers . The Little Boy bomb has a characteristic [ long and thin design ] ( URL_2 ) , this is because the design would literally "" shoot "" a piece of uranium from one end to the other to start the reaction . [ The Fat Man ] ( URL_0 ) bomb put its plutonium core in the middle of a much larger ball of comp - B ( an older version of explosive similar to C-4 ) . When the comp - B was detonated it crushed the plutonium with enough energy to start the fission reaction .",0,reddit_eli5

Between doctors and nurses ( who are generally specialists in a field and therefore more expensive ) , medicine , tests , machines , and even the room and board , a lot of money goes in to even a short and simple stay . More complicated tests , emergency treatment ( ambulances , helicopters , etc ) , and surgery only use up more resources . Hospitals are usually private entities , which means they have to balance cost with price to turn a profit .

Using personal debt to save a company that could have just been dissolved at little cost to their personal credit and finances was, indeed, a very bad move. They might, in the right circumstances, be able to convince a judge to effectively transfer the debt to the corporate entity before liquidating it. That puts the debt where it should have been in the first place, and the CC companies will have to get in line. That means, in turn, that the card issuers will fight any such motion or decision tooth and nail, as long as there's any other option that gives them more hope of recovering their money. Your parents' only prayer for this to happen is if the CCs were used for the sole purpose of business expenses. If they were living off the CCs as well as using them to pay business debts, a judge, best-case, would only relieve the debts directly related to keeping the business afloat, and they'd be on the hook for what they had been living on. Bankruptcy is definitely an option. They will ""re-affirm"" their commitment to paying the mortgage and any other debts they can, and under a Chapter 13 the judge will then remand negotiations over what total portion of each card's balance is paid, over what time, and at what rate, to a mediator. If they have any retirement savings, anything in their name for grandchildren's college funds, etc, the judge and CC issuers will point to it like a bird dog.

Please explain like I'm five.","As a space nerd , learning the stars helped me a lot with orienting myself in terms of compass directions . There 's Polaris , as others have mentioned before , but even if you ca n't find Polaris , the rotation of the Earth can help you . Stars "" move "" to us below on Earth a lot faster than one probably expects ; give it a good five minutes and everything will have slightly shifted , easily telling you what 's heading where . If it 's rising , that 's East , sinking , that 's West . When it comes to sailing , they had tools and training to assist them with this . A sextant is a tool used to measure the altitude of a celestial object relative to the horizon , often the sun or Polaris , in order to figure out their latitude . There were huge charts plotted out with the brightest stars used for navigational purposes , so they 'd know where any celestial body would be at any time of year . They came prepared ! And also -- the stars are indeed moving slowly throughout space , as are we , but it takes thousands of years for the stars to have shifted enough to be inconsistent with old charts . The ancient Egyptians knew of a different pole star ( Thuban ) , but Polaris has been the northern pole star through all of modern history , and will still be reliable as such until about 4000 CE .",0,reddit_eli5

Now what you do when you meditate is that you become aware of the moment : You do n't give a fuck about all those annoying thoughts about yesterday or tomorrow or whatever . Of course there are different approaches , sometimes you focus immensely on something ( often the breath ) which will use up all focus and therefore reduce thoughts , or you try to not - focus , where you feel and observe everything in and around you .

If you do n't believe me get a fish tank and raise a lobster there and see how long it lives . The article says : > which means they would essentially live forever if it were n't for being caught and eaten , or dying from injury or disease . And that is the case with any living organism , the more you get old the more you become prone to diseases and that 's why everybody dies . This article is full of scientific inaccuracy and oversimplification . If it was only one gene responsible for this we would have easily been able to inject it in every living organism in the world . Some other reply here mentioned this : > The genes between humans and lobsters are substantially different . You ca n't just take bits from one and expect the same results in the other . The first part of this is wrong , the second part is right . Simply put , a "" gene "" is just a code the tells the cell how to manufacture a certain protein . Nothing else . So we actually have been able to transfer genes between Humans , mice , cows , flies , plants , bacteria and even algae . For example : By inserting a gene for a florescent protein called GFP ( Green Florescent Protein ) , obtained from sea algae , into mice , we were able to produce florescent mice . See for example : URL_0 So , in principle , we can insert lobster genes into humans . Now , the second part of the statement is true . You ca n't expect similar results by just inserting 1 gene . Genes produce proteins that work in the context of other proteins in the cell or the body to produce results . You ca n't take a computer processor and attach it to a vacuum cleaner and expect to be able to play games on it this way . Genes for extremely complex systems in order to produce even the simplest functions . Now , to insert a gene into an organism requires you to inject this gene into the organism when it is in the stage of a zygote , which means when the sperm and the ovum fuse and before they divide . To be sure that the gene reaches all the cells eventually . ( Actually things are more complicated than this but lets just keep it to the ELI5 level ) This experiment may work or may not work . So we ca n't try it on humans because if the experiment fails , you may get a diseased or disabled human , which is obviously bad for him . So do n't expect any kind of similar experiment done on humans in the near future . May be not in the next 100 years until we can 100 % sure that this can be done safely in humans . Unless of course we get a mad scientist that experiments on prisoners like what happened during the Nazi time , which will also probably take a very long time to do . Note that you would want to know the effect of such gene on a large enough number of "" experimental humans "" over their complete life span to be able to judge the efficacy of a certain gene , and when 1 human lives up to 80 - 85 years old , you can do the math .",0,reddit_eli5

Syria has never had peace , the other countries in the area of gone through periods of hot and cold relations with Israel . * * Why is the United States so involved and siding with Israel ? * * The US supported Israel 's creation for a variety of reasons , a lot had to do with Jews being quite good a lobbying in the late 40s , and Americans having a lot of sympathy stemming from the Holocaust . Since then relations have been good for a lot of reasons . First ; Jews are good at lobbying , and Jews tend to have a high voter turn out , and Jewish populations are especially high in Ohio and Florida ( two large swing states ) . Non - Jewish - Americans do n't tend to vote on Israeli issues ( it 's not a priority ) . This is n't to say Non - Jews are anti - Israel , polls usually come in at around 80 % support for Israel . Second ; Israel has been very good to America , sharing intelligence and technology , America built it 's Nuclear defense program based on what Israel gave them . Third ; very easy to forget right now , Israel was a capitalist democracy during the cold war , this makes them allies by default from 1960 - 90 . More recent reasons ; modern Evangelic Christian theology says that Jesus can come back only when all the Jews live in Israel . Israel must exist for this to happen , so Evangelical Christians vote for pro - Israel candidates . Also , the war on Terrorism . Israel has been fighting terrorist networks for years , and America wants their Intel . Iran and Israel have had tense relations for 30 odd years , since Iran has such an anti - American government , America has to pick Israel in that . * * Why is the answer not so simple as either becoming one country and tearing down the walls or becoming two countries ? * * This is really two questions ; Why ca n't it be one country ? Well , who would rule , both sides claim that they have a right to the land . Many Palestinians want a Palestinian country , not a mix . Jews want a Jewish country . A mixed country would leave one dominant over the other , and one side would be upset by that . Why ca n't it become two countries ? It probably will eventually , it 's tricky though , since the Palestinian government can barely function right now , and many Palestinian groups wo n't accept Israel as a neighbor . There is also the issue of where the borders should be .

Explain like I'm five.","Helen Keller did n't learn much of anything until she met Annie Sullivan , who she called "" Teacher . "" It took a very long time for Helen to start to learn , after all she had spent 5 + years in a dark and silent world , unable to communicate . First Annie had to get and hold her attention , her biography describes Helen as like a wild animal when they first met , which makes sense . Annie would place objects in Helen 's hands and then draw the symbols for the letters of the words on Helen 's palm . For instance , Helen would have known what a cup was for , she would have known what it was when it was put in her hand , but she did n't know the word for it and thus could n't ask for it or tell anyone about it . After months of repetition with the same dozen or so objects Helen finally understood that the sensations Teacher was making on her hand meant the object that was in her other hand , be that cup , toy , water , dress , book etc . Once that understanding was made , Helen could learn more words for more things and eventually she was able to understand each of the symbols drawn on her hand equalled braille letter that she could read with her finger . The symbols that Teacher drew on Helen 's hand were a semi recognised alphabet from a school for the deaf and blind that Annie herself attended for a time . When Helen visited this school , she could communicate with other students by using this method of writing symbols on each others ' hands . Once Helen understood objects , Teacher had to teach her about things like "" happy , "" "" think , "" "" loneliness "" which took a long time as you could imagine . One of the best parts of Annie Sullivan 's biography is when she describes Helen understanding the ideas of fun and joy , after Annie tickled her until she was rolling on the bed in tears of laughter . Helen 's parents came running because they had n't heard their daughter laugh since before she got sick and lost her hearing and sight .",0,reddit_eli5

The erections have nothing to do with arousal in a sexual manner , it is basically a health check .

2579,"Affirmative action . Thanks , I 'm not american and do n't see why this is good for anyone . Explain like I'm five.","In the US , pretty much all blacks originally arrived as slaves , and unlike man whites , had no economic capital after the civil war ( whereupor blacks and whites were both legally free ) . In addition , a variety of laws and practices up and through the 1950s inhibited all blacks from the same opportunities as whites : they were n't allowed the benefits of the GI Bill ( which gave a very cheap education to WWII veterans ) , they were n't allowed to live in "" good "" neighborhoods ( see "" red - lining "" ) , and they were n't allowed to progress in various jobs . Blacks were in a world that empowered whites , and it was n't until the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s that the federal government made a point of enforcing the equality that had technically existed since the 50s . Of course , the government was n't always successful , and legal equality only became a reality in the 1970s . So now we have a bunch of blacks and whites in the US that have very different legacies - whites have educational and economic capital that blacks do n't . Being born black in the US means that you are statistically at a disadvantage , in terms of the schools you have access to and the money you might have to start a business , and so forth . Affirmative action is the choice to promote equal - appearing blacks over whites - to give extra preference to people who do n't and did n't have the resources that whites had . The idea is that by these actions ( like possibly getting one Barack Obama into Harvard law ) blacks can slowly achieve economic and social equality with whites . Now , there are some problems with this , most notably that poor whites ( who did n't get the benefits of the past policies ) get screwed , and that there are rags - to - riches stories of blacks that made it despite the lack of policy help . I 'm not endorsing the practice , but that 's the through process .",0,reddit_eli5
1390,How do physicists entangle particles in quantum entanglement ? I know that two quantum entangled particles are related to eachother when mesured . But how are these particles made ? Please explain like I'm five.,"The simplest example I can think of is by creating two particles that are entangled when they are made . If you 're not familiar with spin , it 's a number that is a measure of angular momentum . You can think of it as just an intrinsic property of particles without actually worrying about what it means . You take a particle(s ) with spin of 0 , then turn it into two particles having spin of , say , 1 . An example might be electron - positron annihilation . If the electron has a spin of +1/2 and the positron has a spin of -1/2 , the total spin of the system is 0 . When they run into each each other they will make two photons . Each photon must have spin of +1 or -1 . There 's a law that says that the total spin of a system must be conserved , the same way energy is conserved . Because the spins have to be 0 , this forces one of the photons to be +1 and the other to be -1 , they ca n't both have the same spin . The thing is , the quantum nature of the photons mean we do n't know which one is which , furthermore , they do n't have a well defined spin until something actually measures it . Say we go in and measure one of the photons . It could be either spin , but let 's say when we measure it as +1 , this forces the second particle to be of spin -1 . If we had measured the first as -1 , the second would be +1 . The key is that neither of these particles had a well defined spin until the moment it was measured , at which point it forced the other to be the opposite direction .",0,reddit_eli5

19559,Remote jobs and incidental wage costs: What do I have to consider?,"An employee costs the company in four ways: Salary, taxes, benefits, and capital. Salary: The obvious one, what they pay you. (There may be other taxes that I'm not thinking of, but in any case those are the main ones.) Benefits: In the U.S. employers often pay for medical insurance, sometimes for dental, life, and disability. There's usually some sort of retirement plan. They expect to give you some number of vacation days, holidays, and sick days where they pay you even though you're not working. Companies sometimes offer other benefits, like discounts on buying company products, membership in health clubs, etc. Capital: Often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment, like a computer; furniture, like a chair and desk; etc. As far as the company is concerned, all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee. If they would pay a domestic employee $60,000 in salary and $20,000 in taxes, then assuming the same benefits and capital investment, if a foreign employee would cost them $0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $80,000. Any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail, and they will likely be totally rational about this. A smaller company might think, ""well, taxes don't really count ..."" This is irrational but people are not always rational. I don't know what benefits they are offering you, if any, and what equipment they will provide you with, if any. I also don't know what taxes, if any, a U.S. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country. If anybody on here knows the answer to that, please chime in. Balanced against that, the company likely sees disadvantages to hiring a foreign remote employee, too. Communication will be more difficult, which may result in inefficiency. My previous employer used some contractors in India and while there were certainly advantages, the language and time zone issues caused difficulties. There are almost certainly some international bureaucratic inconveniences they will have to deal with. Etc. So while you should certainly calculate what it would cost them to have a domestic employee doing the same job, that's not necessarily the end of the story. And ultimately it all comes down to negotiations. Even if the company knows that by the time they add in taxes and benefits and whatever, a domestic employee will cost them $100,000 a year, if they are absolutely convinced that they should be able to hire an Austrian for $60,000 a year, that might be the best offer you will get. You can point out the cost savings, and maybe they will concede the point and maybe not.",0,finance

12365,"What exactly did Obama do to deserve the Nobel Peace Prize ? always puzzled me ... continues to do so .. Should have marked this as [ serious ] , c'm on guys ! Please explain like I'm five.","> There is a lot of confusion as to why a president could win a Nobel Peace Prize into their first year in office . It is especially confusing when there are so many people around the world who are dying for peace , and have arguably made a greater impact . > * * Contrary to popular belief , Obama was * not * awarded the Prize due to him being elected as a black president and people getting "" caught up in the moment "" . It had a lot to do with what he * said * and * did * leading up to October 2009 . We must look at the Norwegian Nobel Committee 's reasons in order to understand why he won . * * > The Norwegian Nobel Committee says that they gave him the prize * * "" for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples . "" * * What are they referring to here ? It takes several months for Nobel Committee Members to write up a report to nominate and select someone for the Prize . Obama gave a very important speech to Egyptians ( called "" A New Beginning "" ) in June 2009 at Cairo University . He was selected in October 2009 . So the Cairo speech had a lot to do with what they refer as "" international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples "" . > How did "" A New Beginning "" foster international diplomacy and cooperation ? After 9/11 and the prolonged Iraq War , one of the most hostile relationships in politics was between the United States and the Arab World . The Israel / Palestine issue is one of the most difficult problems to solve . Egypt is the largest Arab country , and seen as the centre of the Arab world and influential in the outcome of Israel / Palestine peace . So Obama shot for the stars . He went to Egypt to try to ease US - Arab tensions , and kick off a strong Israel / Palestine peace process . > But there 's more ! In the past , American presidents have used very strong , unapologetic language , like that of President George W. Bush . In "" A New Beginning "" , Obama did n't do that . His speech was one of mutual respect , something an American president has n't done in a long , long time . > He also quoted from the Quran ! But so what ! What does that mean anyway ? Well , the concept of recognition is crucial toward building trust . By quoting from the Quran , Obama is implying that he * recognizes * Islam and respects it . Respect is the first step toward peace as it opens up diplomacy . > The Norwegian Nobel Committee also said that Obama 's * * "" vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons "" * * was a reason . This is not particularly important because a lot of presidents have talked about reducing nuclear stockpiles internationally . Particularly , in 1991 , there was a treaty called START which started this process . The Nobel Committee saw that Obama was taking this * even further * . He started writing and talking about a new START treaty to reduce nuclear weapons even before his "" A New Beginning "" speech in June , so the Nobel Committee had a lot of time to consider it . If Obama let the last treaty expire in 2012 , more nuclear weapons would spread around the world . Although he criticized Iran here , he was sure to be fair . And his efforts to be fair were astounding : he admitted that the United States overthrew a democratically elected leader in 1953 , which was very fair . The Nobel Prize committee saw this as him being the "" bigger man "" about the problem . > Also , the Norwegian Nobel Committee said he got the prize because as a result of his speech , * * "" democracy and human rights are to be strengthened "" * * . Obama talked a lot in Cairo about human rights , religious freedom , and the rights of women in his speech . And in Hosni Mubarak 's front door step as well ! That takes nerve . Did his speech have an impact on the Arab Spring ? Certainly . The Egyptian youth were listening to this speech . They wanted democracy before Obama came in , but Obama 's speech gave them support . Obama did n't create the Arab Spring by any means , but it helped a little and set the tone in the Arab world : an American supports and respects Muslims , so how bad could democracy be ? The Norwegian Nobel Committee certainly did n't predict that this would lead to the Arab Spring , but as a group of politicians and students of international relations and political science , they sure understand the impacts that such a speech could have . The Norwegian Nobel Committee also felt that Obama is helping the USA play "" a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting "" . There is very little evidence of Obama addressing climate change in time of the October 2009 decision , but by September , Obama proposed new regulations on industry polluters to curb emissions -- something George W. Bush would n't have done , or did n't do . He strengthened the EPA . > Although not directly mentioned by the Committee , Obama also launched the debate on better healthcare in 2009 , and talked strongly about closing Guantanamo Bay and ending the Iraq War . > Herein lies the problem of giving the award to Obama for many people . Before ending the Iraqi war , the war was scaled up . Indefinite detentions were scaled up by 2012 , not retracted . And the Obama administration took up a smaller role on renewing the Kyoto Protocol than many had expected . Although Obama did * * a lot more for global diplomacy and democracy by October 2009 than many presidents in their entire term * * ( which the Norwegian Nobel Committee noticed ) , in retrospect of three years , a lot of this has been undone by drone strikes , the relative failures of the Copenhagen summit on climate change , and the passing of the National Defence Authorization Act . This is why people like to wait before awarding a Nobel Prize , and why there was criticism . > * * TL;DR : The fact that he 's black and liberal usually overshadows Obama 's achievements up to October 2009 , when he was selected . The truth is that he has done a lot of good in the international community through his speech in Cairo , ratcheting up the reductions of US / Russia nuclear stockpiles , and scaling up emissions regulations through the EPA . A lot of other Peace Prize winners did a lot more in earning their Peace Prize , but some others have done a lot less than Obama to earn their 's . * * > * * EDIT :* * People will inevitably want an analysis on the individual views and biases of those individuals on the Norwegian Nobel Committee . This does n't mean much because it 's speculative , and the Committee members have no reason to lie in their original report , but lets take a look . > * * Chairperson Thorbjørn Jagland * * is a politician for the Norwegian Labour Party . He is pro - European consolidation and president of the Council of Europe . He is known to have preferred the European Union for the Nobel Peace Prize since 2008 . If he had it his way , the EU would 've beat out Obama . > * * Deputy Chairperson Kaci Kullmann Five * * is a politician for the Norwegian Conservative Party . The Conservative Party is a neoliberal party for tax cuts and smaller government . Ironically , despite all the socialists on the committee , * * she is responsible for championing Barack Obama for the Prize * * . > * * Sissel Rønbeck * * is a politician for the Norwegian Labour Party . Her expertise lies in how she is the Minister for Environmental Affairs , and deputy director for the country 's body on Cultural Heritage . She is a socialist . > * * Inger - Marie Ytterhorn * * is a politician for the Norwegian Progress Party . The Progress Party is the main right wing party in Norway and supports the growth of the oil industry and lower taxes . It supports a Christian heritage , and relatively anti - immigrant . > * * Ågot Valle * * is a politician for the Norwegian Socialist Left Party .

7083,Why does it seem like there is so many cases of police brutality / abuse / misbehaviour in the US compared to other developed countries ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"As others have said , guns up the ante , but that still does n't explain many of the strange cases of needless brutality . I think we 'll have to look in another directon : education . In the US , a police education is fairly short , and that means that they will not have proper training in law , in how to take the pressure out of a loaded situation and psychology . They are just given a basic training , a vague idea of the law , given a gun and told to "" Go out and keep the order ! "" . Basically , it 's the Stanford Experiment on a grand scale . Compare this to , for example , Sweden , which I happen to know more about ( I 'm Swedish ) . Here , to become a police , you need three years high school AND three years specific police training at university level ( and fairly high grades are needed to get in ) . The police know the law better , they are trained to defuse tense situations , they are trained not to see the people as threats , they are trained to take people down with minimum of risk for all involved . Not that this stops the Swedish police from effing up , but at least they do it less often ...",0,reddit_eli5

16227,"Why ca n't Tim Tebow Be a starting Quarterback in the NFL ? He seems like he does all the right things but he always gets bashed for throwing mechanics and "" normal "" QB talent . What s the deal ? Explain like I'm five.","Tebow is unquestionably a solid athlete . He can run very well . He has strength . He is willing to play on special teams , demonstrating selflessness . However , his passing ability is pretty limited . In college , a QB can get away with a mediocre arm if he can run a little . If you ever watch college football , you 'll see that there are a ton of running plays , passes are short , and there 's a heavy emphasis on the option play . ( An option is where the QB run to the side . If he thinks he can gain lots of yards , he heads forward . If there 's a defender in his way , he quickly tosses the ball to a teammate behind him . ) Tebow did very well in this style of play . However , in college , talent is spread out among hundreds of teams and players only get 4 years to play . In the NFL , there are only 32 teams with players able to play as long as they can , along with excellent training . What does this mean for an offense ? It means that you have to play every game against essentially an all - star team . Defenders are too fast and good at tackling for you to get by with just QB runs , short passes , and the occassional option . In short , a QB must be a good passer . So , let 's look at Tebow 's NFL passing . I 'm going to focus on his stats in [ 2011 ] ( URL_0 ) , since that 's when he got lots of playing time and he gained a lot of notoriety . In that season , he got to start all the games after the bye week . Look at those 11 weeks . On only 2 occasions did he pass for over 200 yards . If you include rushing yards , he certainly did better , but there was never an instance where his total yards hit 300 . People love to hate Mark Sanchez , but he got 300 passing yards 3 times this year . And Sanchez was n't on as good a team as Tebow when he started . Now that we 've established that Tebow is n't great in terms of yards , what about winning ? Tebow supporters point to the fact that the Broncos won games when Tebow started . That 's true , but it only happened because the team 's defense stepped up their game . An average NFL team scores in the low 20s in an average game . In Tebow 's 11 starts , the Broncos only had 3 games where they scored at least 20 points . Does it take talent to score 17 points in the NFL ? Of course . Does that achievement explain the amount of hype Tebow received ? No . In short , Tebow is n't the worst QB in the world . He could definitely beat me or you in any football - related competition . He just is n't particularly good by any measure when compared against other QBs in the NFL , mainly due to his lack of passing ability . The reason he get insulted so much is that he got so much undeserved attention after a mediocre season ( although the attention probably was n't his fault ) . As a result , he 's earned a reputation as being overrated and is stuck with expectations that he does not appear capable of meeting .",0,reddit_eli5

16799,What just happened with bitcoin ? Not into stocks or shares or anything . Just a workin ' class dude . Woke up and saw a couple people posting their debts are paid off . What just happened and how behind the times am I ? Explain like I'm five.,"As someone who 's taking an interest in the technology behind Bitcoin , I 'll give you a short overview . 1 . The coins are "" mined "" by folks crunching numbers . 2 . The integrity of the network is preserved by a running log of everything everyone ever did ( meaning , from the first coins mined to the last coin spent - it 's all written down in a journal ) . 3 . The network is secure because accounts are protected by private keys and the SHA256 algorithm used to protect the contents is ( currently ) more or less impenetrable . 4 . The transaction is then passed around until a consensus is reached as it its validity ; if less than 50 % of the nodes think you should be able to make the transaction then it is voided . 5 . The algorithm is self - correcting for mining rates , meaning that the first guys to crunch a few numbers got coins every 10 minutes and now that thousands of people are mining with fast hardware , it 's become more difficult so that the 10 minute average is maintained . 6 . The coin supply dwindles two ways . First , the number of coins per solution goes down over the years . It was 50 , now it 's 25 , eventually it 'll be zero around 2140 . Second , the chances of solving a block and the returns for doing so diminish greatly as the work is spread around to more and faster computers . Just ten days ago , my mining computer could find .12 bitcoins per day . With this bubble and/or boom going on , more people have started mining and I 'm down to about .075 . So , why is it valuable ? Well , like someone said below , I might as well be the one to say it - money is only worth what we agree it 's worth . Federal currency ( $ USD , for example ) has a huge structure behind it to try to maintain its value , and some folks think it 's unsustainable . Bitcoin has no such structure . You ca n't issue it any faster than the algorithm allows . You ca n't print more , you ca n't spend it if you do n't have it ( yet , wait for banks to get involved on this one ) , and you ca n't steal it if it 's properly secured . This makes it every bit as safe as the $ USD in terms of storage and security , and quite a bit more secure than the $ USD in terms of safety from administration . The fed can not print another million bitcoins , only a few years of mining can do that . Scarcity is built into the system . So , is it a ponzi scheme ? Yes , in a way . The very early adopters hold hundreds , even thousands , of the coins . At current market rates , they 're probably slowly selling them off for literally millions of dollars . The thing is , they 've created a monster ... whether or not the intent was to get rich on a ponzi scheme , the bitcoin currency still exists and it 's still secure . If they cash out , the decentralized nature of Bitcoin means that it still exists and can still be used . So what 's bad about a currency that allows you to very quickly transfer value from one account to another regardless of nationality , location , and social standing ? Well , the worst part from an investor 's point of view is that it 's completely and utterly * new * . Nothing like this has ever caught on before . It 's been around for four years , people have had a long time to poke holes in the security , and it 's matured into a valid commodity . Some of it was intentional and some of it was not ( big cheeses in the financial industry are commenting on it ; that garners a lot of attention ) . As people notice it , they want a piece of it ( however small ) "" just in case "" it goes crazy for real . This forces the bubble to grow . Nothing is forcing the bubble to pop , either : If the million or so Bitcoin holders today dilute their holdings out to ten million total people , the value will increase roughly by an order of magnitude ( simple supply and demand ) . That means if you have a bitcoin you bought at $ 200 , it 'll technically be worth $ 2000 . The coins are divisible and transferable down to 8 decimal places so the currency can support a fairly massive unit value . Again , the new nature of this means every prediction you read is pure speculation . It could crash tomorrow , or an investment bank could try to buy up half of it . Either way , I 'm riding it out with a few coins * just in case * I become an accidental millionaire . Hope this clears it up a bit . It 's really pretty interesting and there are tomes of information to read if you want to learn more . Cheers ! Edit : Tips , gold , and much love ! I 'm just trying to share some info ; I 'm really glad you guys appreciate it . Keep on being awesome ! Edit 2 : 400 messages & replies and counting . I 'm really not supposed to be the BTC spokesperson ; I hope I 'm getting more of this right than wrong ! I wanted to clear up a question that keeps appearing though : Why do you mine and what are you mining ? Mining is the process by which we confirm the transactions and make sure no one 's cheating . The more miners you have , the safer the network of coins is and the harder ( or , further past impossible ) it is to make an invalid transaction ( i.e. , moving coins you do n't have ) . The current reward for mining is new coins . Eventually the reward will be much smaller , dwindling to a tiny fraction of each transaction so that people are still willing to mine . The system taxes itself to pay a bit to those who work for it .",0,reddit_eli5

10893,"What do the 3rd , 2nd and 1st dimension look like in 4 dimensional space ? Would our 3 - dimensional world appear as our 2 - dimensional(flat ) in the 4th dimension ? Explain like I'm five.","Without going into too much detail : that would depend on how our 3D world is embedded in side the 4D world . That is , the geometric properties of , say , a piece of paper change depending on if the paper is lying flat on a table , or curled up into a cylinder , although in both cases it would be a 2D object embedded in 3D space . ( The following is n't going to be quite at a 5 - year - old level , I 'm afraid . ) For example , it 's fun to try and visualize a 3 - sphere in 4 - dimensional space . Just as a 2 - sphere ( i.e. an ordinary sphere in our 3 - dimensional world ) is the boundary of a solid 3 - dimensional ball , a 3 - sphere is the boundary of a solid 4 - dimensional ball . Such a sphere can be described as the set of points equidistant from some single fixed point in 4 - dimensional space , and there are various details one needs to work out but the point is that this description leads to a pretty neat way of visualizing a bit of what 's going on in 4D space . You can assume that the tennis ball has radius 1 . 1 ) . These cross sections , in turn , end up completely determining the tennis ball : if you were given only these cross sections and their corresponding z - coordinates , then all you have to do to reconstruct the tennis ball is just stack up the cross sections in the right order , as determined by their z - coordinates . Notice that these cross sections are snapshots of 1 - dimensional objects ( circles ) in 2 - dimensional space ( the xy - planes that we took the cross sections with ) . In a completely analogous fashion we can construct the 3 - sphere , which lives in 4 - dimensional space , using snapshots of 2 - dimensional objects in 3 - dimensional space . . Just as you sliced into the tennis ball at various heights with 2 - dimensional planes , you are slicing into the 3 - sphere at various "" heights "" with 3 - dimensional "" planes "" . What do these slices look like ? The sphere keeps expanding as time passes , until it reaches its maximum radius of 1 at time z=0 , after which it starts contracting until it turns back into a point at time z=1 . ( I dislike this last method because it 's kind of a cop - out which tends to obscure the raw geometry of the thing you 're studying . ) When you stack all of these cross sections together , the totality of the resulting object is a 3 - sphere . Anyways I hope that was even just a little bit interesting / useful to you .",0,reddit_eli5

14883,"- How are light and radio waves the same thing ? Light in my limited understanding is photons , and ( in the visible spectrum ) can be blocked by your hand for example , are all radio waves photons , simply alternating at a slower pace ? Explain like I'm five.",""" Light , "" referring to visible light , is simply a more excited particle as compared to radio waves . These particles interact with the world around us . The reason on why visible light ca n't pass * as well * through most matter is complicated , but basically it comes down to how long the light can interact with substance . Imagine asteroids traveling through our solar system , but instead of going straight through , they travel [ "" up and down , "" ] ( URL_0 ) which I 'll call traveling vertical . All asteroids , generally , travel at the same longitudinal speed . However , some asteroids travel vertically very quickly and others are hardly noticeable ( they are seemingly traveling straight ) . The ones that have very fast vertical speed have many times more kinetic energy ( as they are actually moving a lot more / faster ) . If one of these super - fast asteroids neared Jupiter , the gravity of Jupiter would have next - to - no effect on the asteroid as it already has so much forward momentum . Even if it enters the gaseous part of Jupiter , it would probably just blow right through it , bringing large amounts of gas with it . Only if it directly hits the core , and only sometimes , will it collide with Jupiter . Chances are Jupiter will be KO'd . The ones that have very slow vertical speed have very low kinetic energy , but travel relatively straight distances . Most of these wo n't even have a chance to become near Jupiter ( they 'll go "" over "" or "" under "" ) . If they do near her , they 'll probably be sucked it . Jupiter suffers no damage . Some , however , fit a Goldilocks of nearing Jupiter , yet traveling slow enough for Jupiter to be pulled in . Most of these asteroids will be pulled into Jupiter , and will have enough energy to do some damage . Some gas may be pushed away . None of the core , however . Light interacts much the same way and matter is as empty as space is . High - energy light will most likely just have so much energy it 'll just zoom away . Low - energy light generally does n't even near the mass of the matter . However , the middle ground , visible light , will near the mass and have low enough energy to be pulled in . Know that , no matter the energy , some photons can get through and not all visible light is equal . Red travels through flesh much easier than blue ( test this with a red laser light and a blue LED ) . Ultraviolet has a near - impossible time getting through ( and is completely absorbed by the skin ) . Radiowaves and microwaves have a hard time getting through meters of rock ( thus the failing in tunnels ) . Edit : I 'll also like to point out that it makes logical sense that we only see visible light . In order for eyes to even be feasible , the light would need to be able to interact . While microwaves or ultraviolet light may react , they are either too unreliable ( microwaves ) or destroy whatever is in their path ( ultraviolet ) . Visible light is nice to matter . It 'll readily interact and only has minor effect ( hardly ever destroys molecules ) . This is why our eyes , as well as most organisms eyes , work off visible light . It 's akin to why life likes a certain temperature . Things work easier at this Goldilocks zone .",0,reddit_eli5

We do n't know that they * can * exist or if they are stable , but the general idea is that empty space as we know it has an energy level associated with it .

This is the general basis behind theories about "" tapping zero - point energy "" ; the "" zero point "" is the lowest possible energy level which , surprisingly , is not actually zero . Now the "" death bubble "" concept comes up when we consider that entropy generally states that things tend toward the lowest energy level possible as they are more stable . Conceptually then it may be possible that our current universe is not in the lowest possible energy level and could somehow decay into a lower energy state . How or why this could happen we do n't know , but if it did we would expect the fabric of the universe to change into something fundamentally different , expanding outward in all directions at the speed of light . When this region passed over an existing area of space the fundamental particles making up everything would cease to be , converting into something else . Even the fundamental forces of our universe would likely be changed along with the existing dimensions .

15015,"Why countries and regions have different accents . How do accents come to fruition ? What factors affect the sound of an accent ? Is the American accent a "" combination "" of the accents of the original immigrants ? Explain like I'm five.","To answer the rest of the questions you asked , OP , there are many factors that affect the "" sound "" of a given dialect . Aside from the social factors that NobblyNobody and I mentioned , there are a number of linguistic factors as well . Most are rather complicated , but suffice it to say that languages are complex systems , and ( sound ) changes are often driven by how easily sounds are produced or perceived , or by relations among groups of sounds . For example , "" th "" sounds are relatively uncommon in the world 's languages ( and many English dialects do n't have them ) because they 're rather difficult to hear in noise . ' Chain shifts ' are an example of another , slightly more complicated process . Because vowels are naturally spread out ( in terms of where in the mouth they 're produced ) in a kind of equilibrium , sometimes relatively small changes can cause chain reactions leading to a reorganization of a language / dialect 's entire vowel system . A famous example of this is [ the Great Vowel Shift ] ( URL_0 ) , which happened during the Middle English period and is responsible for many of the odd spellings still found in English . Another , more current example , is what 's called the Northern Cities Chain Shift . This is the vowel shift that 's responsible for the distinctive sound that speakers from Chicago , Detroit , etc . , have ( think about stereotypical pronunciations of words like "" cat "" and "" Chicago "" ) . Think of these chain shifts like big games of musical chairs , but with vowels . Here 's [ a YouTube clip from "" Do You Speak American ? "" with Bill Labov ] ( URL_1 ) , the founder of modern sociolinguistics , talking about the NCCS . As for American dialects being a "" combination "" of the dialects spoken by the original immigrants , in some sense , yes they are . Many features can still be traced back to founding populations , the Scots - Irish and people from southern England . This is called ' the Founder Effect ' . There are also words and grammatical features that have been preserved in North American dialects of English , but lost in British English . The use of "" fall "" instead of "" autumn "" , for instance . Of course , a lot of time has elapsed since the settling of North America so many distinctive features have emerged as well , but the founding population always has a large effect on the direction and character of a dialect . Finally , when you get diverse , large - scale migrations into a region ( e.g. westward expansion in the US ) , this sometimes results in ' dialect leveling ' , which just basically means that the resulting dialect ( after a couple generations ) is a combination of the most common features found among the founding groups . The linguistic lowest common denominator . This is why English in the western half of the US is not as distinct as English on the east coast of the US , or in England ( although it also has to due with the fact that the west coast was settled much more recently than the east ) .",0,reddit_eli5

18587,"Please explain what is ""Lebesgue integration""","In mathematics, the integral of a non-negative function of a single variable can be regarded, in the simplest case, as the area between the graph of that function and the x-axis. The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons. However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e.g., as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral. Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the necessary abstractions for this.The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904). It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability.The term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on a sub-domain of the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.",0,wikipedia_csai
6210,Money laundering I 'd really appreciate an example - based explanation for this . EDIT : Thanks for the quick and great answers !

And there 's no documentation of where the money came from for tax reporting , but to NOT report the income is tax evasion -- that 's how the Feds finally got Al Capone . So you have a cash - heavy business as a front and funnel the money into that so it looks like revenue brought into the business . $ 10,000 in $ 20 's and $ 50 's does n't look suspicious to the bank if it 's the deposit from a laundromat or car wash .

20602,What's the best way to make money from a market correction?,"A lot of people here talk about shorting stocks, buying options, and messing around with leveraged ETFs. While these are excellent tools, that offer novel opportunities for the sophisticated investor, Don't mess around with these until you have been in the game for a few years. Even if you can make money consistently right out of the gate, don't do it. Why? It's hard to measure the scope of the risk you are assuming with these strategies, much less manage it when things head south. So even if you've gotten lucky enough to have figured  out how to make money, you surely haven't learned out how to hold on to it. I am certain that every beginner still hasn't figured out how to comprehend risk and manage losing positions. It's one of those things you only figure out after dealing with it. Despite what others may say you can make out really well just trading stocks. That being said, one of my favorite beginner strategies is buying stocks that dip for reasons that don't fundamentally affect the company's ability to make money in the mid term (2 quarters). A good example is Netflix back in 2007. There was a lawsuit because netflix was throttling movie deliveries to high traffic consumers. The stock dropped a good chunk overnight. A more recent example is petrobras after their huge bond sale and subsequent corruption scandal. A lot of people questioned Petrobras' long-term ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay back the loans, but the cashflow and long term projections are more than solid. A year later the stock was pushed further down because a lot of amateur Brazilians invest in Petrobras and they sold while the stock was artificially depressed due to a string of corruption scandals and poor, though temporary, economic conditions. One of my favorite plays back in 2008-2011 was First Solar on the run-up to earnings calls. Analysts would always come out of these meetings downgrading the stock and the forums were full of pikers and pumpers claiming heavy put positions. The stock would go down considerably, but would always pop around earnings. I've made huge returns on this move. Those were the good ole days. Start off just googling financial news and blogs and look for lawsuits and/or scandals. Manufacturing defects or recalls. Starting looking for companies that react predictably to certain events. If you don't know how to back-test events, learn it. Google Finance had a tool for that back in the day that was rudimentary but helpful for those starting out. These days automated trading also seems to be ever more important, even for the small fish. 2) Analytical Thinking learn to spot patterns of the three types:  event based (lawsuits, arbitrage, earnings etc), technical (emas, price action, sup/res), or business-oriented (accounting, strategy, marketing). Don't just listen to what someone else says you should do at any particular moment, critical thinking is essential. Your emotions are like a blade that you must sharpen every day if you want to stay in the game. Disclaimer: I stopped using this strategy in 2011, and moved to a pure technical trading regime. I've been out totally out of the game since 2015.",0,finance

Frequency and orientation representations of Gabor filters are claimed by many contemporary vision scientists to be similar to those of the human visual system. They have been found to be particularly appropriate for texture representation and discrimination. In the spatial domain, a 2-D Gabor filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave (see Gabor transform).Some authors claim that simple cells in the visual cortex of mammalian brains can be modeled by Gabor functions. Thus, image analysis with Gabor filters is thought by some to be similar to perception in the human visual system.",0,wikipedia_csai

Please explain like I'm five.,"I have been vaccinated for anthrax , but it is because I work with it . Yes , anthrax is present throughout the US ( and other countries ) , but unless you work with sheep to cattle on a daily basis , the chance of you coming into contact with the Bacillus anthracis bacterium is slim .

18892,"Please explain what is ""Computer-assisted diagnosis""","Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.CAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.CAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.Although CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (“flat”) lesions in CT colonography.",0,wikipedia_csai

7741,Why do some religions still condemn things that are now ' socially accepted ' ? Such as homosexuality Please explain like I'm five.,"As a Christian , I 'll answer for Christians only , but I imagine similar reasoning is at play for other religions . Christians believe that the Bible is the true word of God ; that everything it contains was written by people whom God used to convey his words . Christians believe that this makes what is taught in the Bible extremely important . Christians also believe that the Bible is a "" meta - narrative "" , which means it is piece of work that is true in all time periods and for all people . As a Christian , I feel it is important to explain why Christians care so much about what other people are doing , rather than "" living and letting live "" . Jesus told his disciples to travel out after his death and resurrection , and to teach the Gospel ( the story and teachings of Jesus Christ ) to all people . Sometimes , what people ( both Christians and non - Christians ) focus on is the list of "" don'ts "" , instead of the true message of Jesus : that Jesus is God , that he lived a sinless life , and died so that anyone who believes in him can be restored to the perfect creation they were meant to be , and can live forever in the presence of God . So the answer , when you dig down , is because Christians love the world . We want everyone to experience the true happiness and satisfaction that can only be found in having a relationship with Jesus . Those Christians who act hatefully are wrong ; it 's certainly not my place to say who is or is n't a Christian , and we all fail to live up to God 's perfection , but not everyone who claims to be a Christian , is one .

The increased visibility is also very useful. Look at Google or FB. They didn't need the IPO proceed when they went public. They had enough cash from their business but then they would only have $1-10 billion a year. But due to the IPO their investors and employees have a huge net worth.

16926,"What Are Integrals and Derivatives ( in Calculus ) ? Dear The People of /r / explainlikeimfive , How do integrals relate to derivatives and what are they ? How do I come up with an integral and how do I use it with derivatives ? Sincerely , Krock999 Explain like I'm five.","There are two things called "" integral "" . They 're secretly the same thing , though ! But to understand what those are , we have to start with the derivative . Say you 're driving along the road . There 's traffic , so sometimes you 're going at 30 mi / hr , sometimes at 70 mi / hr . So maybe at 6:00 you 're at mile 15 , and at 7:00 you 're at mile 65 . So x(6 ) = 15 and x(7 ) = 65 . Simple , right ? Maybe at 6:00 you hit some bad traffic and are going at 15 mi / hr , but luckily the traffic cleared so by 7:00 you 're cruising at 75 mi / hr , hoping that you do n't get caught speeding by a cop for being 10 mi / hr over the speed limit ! Your speed v(t ) is obviously related to how far you 've traveled , but how ? This is just the average . If you plot out x(t ) on a graph , pick a point , pick another point REALLY close by , and draw a line from one to the other , the slope of that line will be v(t ) . It makes sense : for two moments t and t + h , the average speed is the distance you traveled between them -- x(t + h ) - x(t ) -- divided by the time it took -- h. The derivative is what happens when you take the average speed over a REALLY short distance , when h is very close to 0 . It turns out that it 's really easy ( sometimes , anyway ) to take the derivative of a function . So derivatives are n't just the slope of something on a graph ; they 're also a thing you can do to a function to get another function . There are a few different ways of notating that . If you have f(x ) , usually the derivative will be f'(x ) or df(x)/dx . You can take a derivative of * that * if you want . That 's called the second derivative , f''(x ) or d^2 f(x)/dx^2 . If you have a time derivative -- that is , a derivative where the variable is time , t -- another way to write it is to put a dot on top of the function . So df(t)/dt can be written as f with a dot on top . Physicists do this . Now , suppose you took a derivative . What was the original function ? That 's called an * * integral * * , or , in this case , an antiderivative . It just means to undo a derivative . So if f'(x ) = 2x , you can take the integral and get f(x ) = x^2 + C. The + C is important because the derivative of a constant is 0 -- how quickly does a constant change ? Well , it does n't ! So you can add a constant to a function and it does n't change the derivative . x^2 , x^2 + 1 , x^2 - 500 , etc . all have the same derivative , 2x . So when we do an antiderivative , we have to put a + C there since that constant can be anything at all . Anyway , you can write the integral of f(x ) as ∫f(x)dx . This actually kinda makes sense . You know how the derivative is df(x)/dx ? That means a small difference in f(x ) divided by a small difference in x. Well , with integrals , the ∫ is actually a big S and it means "" sum "" , so ∫f(x)dx means to add up f(x ) times the small quantity dx . Still not making sense ? That 's because there 's * another * thing called an integral , and it 's actually the same ! Say you draw a curve y = f(x ) . The integral ∫f(x)dx from a to b ( the a goes on the bottom of the ∫ and b on top ) is the * area under the curve * of y = f(x ) between x = a and x = b. So why are these called the same thing with the same symbol ? Well , let 's say ∫f(x)dx = F(x ) , so the antiderivative of f(x ) is F(x ) . Then ∫f(x)dx from a to b = F(b ) - F(a ) . That 's called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus . So they 're the same after all ! Anyway , this was probably too fast for a 5 - year - old , but hopefully next time you look at it , you 'll understand a little bit more .",0,reddit_eli5

18981,"Please explain what is ""Human computation""","Human-based computation (HBC), human-assisted computation, ubiquitous human computing or distributed thinking (by analogy to distributed computing) is a computer science technique in which a machine performs its function by outsourcing certain steps to humans, usually as microwork. This approach uses differences in abilities and alternative costs between humans and computer agents to achieve symbiotic human–computer interaction. For computationally difficult tasks such as image recognition, human-based computation plays a central role in training Deep Learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems. In this case, human-based computation has been referred to as human-aided artificial intelligence.In traditional computation, a human employs a computer to solve a problem; a human provides a formalized problem description and an algorithm to a computer, and receives a solution to interpret. Human-based computation frequently reverses the roles; the computer asks a person or a large group of people to solve a problem, then collects, interprets, and integrates their solutions. This turns hybrid networks of humans and computers into ""large scale distributed computing networks"". where code is partially executed in human brains and on silicon based processors.",0,wikipedia_csai

8019,"Wave / particle duality of electrons It 's a popular thing that movie makers exploit all the time . But how does it work , and why is it important ? I 'm not sure what the difference is with elliptical orbiting electrons Explain like I'm five.","For example , you could have 12 marbles , but you ca n't really have 12.5 marbles -- you would just have 12 marbles and some broken glass . By contrast , you can have 1 cup of water , or 1.5 cups , or 1 and 3/4 liters , or what have you -- any of these things is reasonable . When we ( as a species ) started to uncover the nature of matter and came across electrons they were first found as discrete , individual balls of charge with a little mass . We found that you can have 1 electron or 2 electrons , but you ca n't have 1.5 electrons -- it just does n't make sense to talk about fractions of electrons ; they do n't exist . In this sense we started to imagine electrons as little bitty particles . This is emphasized in popular descriptions of the atom , often based on the Bohr Model -- it 's the model that looks like a planet ( nucleus ) with moons ( electrons ) orbiting it . That model works quite nicely and makes lots of accurate predictions about the behavior of atoms , especially with respect to chemistry . However , as we looked deeper we realized that electrons behave like a wave . An example of this is the famous double slit experiment -- if you send a wave towards a wall with two small holes in it then you get a certain interference pattern . [ Here ] ( URL_1 ) is a video from MIT that shows the pattern that you get from this experiment using water , which we know to allow waves ( it starts with single slits and moves to double slit interference later in the video ) . When we fired a stream of electrons at a pair of slits we got an odd result . Rather than the expected lack of interference that particles experience ( imagine throwing a tennis ball through a hole in the fence -- its path is unaltered ) , the electrons actually deflected and gave an interference pattern that suggests that they are actually traveling as a * wave * . The experiment showed that the electrons were interfering with each other . As if that were n't brain - exploding enough , they then repeated the experiment shooting only one electron at a time and came up with the same pattern -- the electron travels through * both * slits , interferes with itself , then finally impacts the surface on which the interference pattern is being observed . For a particle such a description is ludicrous , but for a wave the description is expected . Returning to the structure of the atom , I mentioned the Bohr model earlier but that model is ultimately inaccurate . A more correct model is the electron cloud model -- it has the nucleus in the middle and the electrons "" smeared out "" across the space around it . The shape of the area across which the electron is spread is determined by where the electron can exist as a standing wave ( [ video ] ( URL_0 ) demonstrating standing waves on a slinkey ) . This resonance is a characteristic of a wave , not a particle . Most modern physical models for an electron treat it as a wave , but it is a special wave that is strictly countable / quantifiable . It turns out that the same is true of many other things . For example , light travels as waves in the electric and magnetic field , but light can be strictly counted as a number of photons ; light also exhibits interference patterns in a double slit pattern ( even using only 1 photon at a time ) .",0,reddit_eli5

Explain like I'm five.","hard drives contain 2 key parts : 1)read /write head : a sometimes magnetized pin that can move left and right . 2 ) platter : a metallic disk that holds the data . you can visualize the data with this simple analogy . imagine you have a very long thin glass tabletop . now pour tiny metallic shards in a straight line . hold a strong magnet over a small region of the long thin line of metallic shards . those metallic shards will stand up . they will stay standing up even after you remove the magnet . you just created a 1 ; create more 1s by you moving left and right at regular intervals . To make that 1 a 0 simply put the magnet on the underside of the glass table and the metallic shards will fall back in line with the rest of the shards . The glass table and the metal shards are the platter . Crudely that is how a hard drive stores data . What does storing data on a hard drive have to do with defragging ? I thought you would never ask ! lets continue . When you want to read that file again the read / write head must lookup the location of the file in the filesystem(like a table of contents for the platter and outside the scope of this explanation ) . The filesystem then tells the read / write head what part or parts of the platter to go to to retrieve the file . Seems simple . Hard drives likes to put things in order just like you would if you had a 20 foot long glass table top with metal shards . Would n't you like to have that term paper you wrote in order when you went to retrieve it ? That term paper would be worthless if the words were out of order . That is how you would obviously start . You left some space to finish the term paper . The paper goes longer than expected ( rare I know ) but you add a works cited page and whatnot . Ok you ran out of space to retrieve that term paper in order . When you want to read /write to that term paper you have to keep track of 2 sections of that table . And walk double the distance . Or for that matter a series of files commonly accessed at the same time . TL;DR – a fragmented hard drive is when the drive is no longer storing directories , files common accessed at the same time , or even single files in linear order . Its chopped up – fragmented . Defragging puts these commonly accessed files in a physically closer location location to each other . This reduces the actual distance the read write head must move .",0,reddit_eli5
18866,"Please explain what is ""Active contour model""","Active contour model, also called snakes, is a framework in computer vision introduced by Michael Kass, Andrew Witkin, and Demetri Terzopoulos for delineating an object outline from a possibly noisy 2D image. The snakes model is popular in computer vision, and snakes are widely used in applications like object tracking, shape recognition, segmentation, edge detection and stereo matching.A snake is an energy minimizing, deformable spline influenced by constraint and image forces that pull it towards object contours and internal forces that resist deformation. Snakes may be understood as a special case of the general technique of matching a deformable model to an image by means of energy minimization. In two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learnt from a training set.Snakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand. Rather, they depend on other mechanisms such as interaction with a user, interaction with some higher level image understanding process, or information from image data adjacent in time or space.",0,wikipedia_csai

Please explain like I'm five.","Without going into too much detail : that would depend on how our 3D world is embedded in side the 4D world . That is , the geometric properties of , say , a piece of paper change depending on if the paper is lying flat on a table , or curled up into a cylinder , although in both cases it would be a 2D object embedded in 3D space . ( The following is n't going to be quite at a 5 - year - old level , I 'm afraid . ) For example , it 's fun to try and visualize a 3 - sphere in 4 - dimensional space . Just as a 2 - sphere ( i.e. an ordinary sphere in our 3 - dimensional world ) is the boundary of a solid 3 - dimensional ball , a 3 - sphere is the boundary of a solid 4 - dimensional ball . Such a sphere can be described as the set of points equidistant from some single fixed point in 4 - dimensional space , and there are various details one needs to work out but the point is that this description leads to a pretty neat way of visualizing a bit of what 's going on in 4D space . You can assume that the tennis ball has radius 1 . 1 ) . These cross sections , in turn , end up completely determining the tennis ball : if you were given only these cross sections and their corresponding z - coordinates , then all you have to do to reconstruct the tennis ball is just stack up the cross sections in the right order , as determined by their z - coordinates . Notice that these cross sections are snapshots of 1 - dimensional objects ( circles ) in 2 - dimensional space ( the xy - planes that we took the cross sections with ) . In a completely analogous fashion we can construct the 3 - sphere , which lives in 4 - dimensional space , using snapshots of 2 - dimensional objects in 3 - dimensional space . . Just as you sliced into the tennis ball at various heights with 2 - dimensional planes , you are slicing into the 3 - sphere at various "" heights "" with 3 - dimensional "" planes "" . What do these slices look like ? The sphere keeps expanding as time passes , until it reaches its maximum radius of 1 at time z=0 , after which it starts contracting until it turns back into a point at time z=1 . ( I dislike this last method because it 's kind of a cop - out which tends to obscure the raw geometry of the thing you 're studying . ) When you stack all of these cross sections together , the totality of the resulting object is a 3 - sphere .

When it rotates it can adjust the speed of the tail rotor . Explain like I'm five. ","Visualize a helicopter with two rotor blades , just to make it easier . And let 's just ignore the tail rotor and the engine for now . Focusing only on the rotor and how it controls the movement of the helicopter , there are two controls the pilot uses . One is called the collective , and one is called the cyclic . The rotor blades on a helicopter are wings . Another term for helicopter is "" rotary wing aircraft "" , as opposed to "" fixed wing aircraft "" . The blades spin through the air , and their * angle of attack * can be adjusted as they spin . You can think of "" angle of attack "" as simply tilting the blade . If you increase the angle of attack , or tilt the blades down , they push more air down , generating lift . Back to "" collective "" and "" cyclic "" . "" Collective "" means increasing the angle of attack of both blades simultaneously , and throughout the entire rotation . This can be thought of as simply pushing air down to make the helicopter go up . "" Cyclic "" refers to making an adjustment to the angle of attack at a certain point in the blade 's cycle . That is , the pilot is able to change the angle of the blade at a certain point , such as the front of the aircraft , or to either side . If you increase the angle of attack of the blade while it is on the right side of the helicopter , the right side will get more lift and the helicopter will tilt toward the left and move that direction . In reality , all the mechanics and forces involved are quite a bit more complicated , but that 's a very basic breakdown of how the rotors themselves operate . The blades can be adjusted collectively , which is how helicopters go up and down , and they can also be adjusted individually at any point in the cycle , which is how helicopters move forward / backward and left / right .

15826,"Imaginary numbers and i ( Square root of -1 ) I took a look over the simple wiki page .. And though it made me get it a bit more , I 'm still almost as confused as I was when I did n't know yet . Explain like I'm five.","IAmMe1 's explanation is awesome . A few other notes that I always found helpful : 1 . There is one and only one imaginary number : i = = sqrt(-1 ) 2 . As others have said , the term "" imaginary "" is awful . You could just as easily call it the igloo number or iguana number and it would mean just as much 3 . One thing that helps make the idea of the "" imaginary number "" authentic is a "" proof "" that the imaginary number MUST exist . As you may know , the number of roots to any equation is equal to the highest power in the equation : URL_1 Thus , for x^2 - 64=0 , there must be 2 solutions : x=8 and x=-8 are the two solutions For x^3 - 64 , there are three solutions : x=4 is one solution , and there are two other numbers . But if you try to draw the function on the cartesian plane , you ca n't visually find the other two y=0 intercepts . The reason why you ca n't find it is because the roots do not exist in the real number domain . So mathematicians , when they plugged the function into their "" root generating algorithm "" decided that if you ignore the ridiculousness of sqrt(-1 ) and just continue anyway , you can get the other two values with some good precision ( albeit , they contain sqrt(-1 ) in them : -2 + 3.4641 * sqrt(-1 ) and -2 - 3.4641 * sqrt(-1 ) ) . * * Edit : Not all quadratic equations have real solutions . Eg . x^2 + 1 never crosses y=0 if you draw it on a graph , but since you know there are two roots , you just set x^2 + 1 = 0 and you discover that the two roots must be sqrt(-1 ) and -sqrt(-1 ) .

2655,- Islamic/ Sharia Banking I understand that usury ( interest ) is not allowed but I 'm still unclear on the work arounds . Explain like I'm five.,"Shariah compliant banking is a very broad topic and the concept of finance in society according to Islamic thinking is , to my understanding , based primarily on ' Utility ' rather than ' for profit ' - serving an essential element of society like we would dispense healthcare , or electricity and water etc . Investments would need to be in ethically aware companies , ensuring any harm is not promoted , i.e. no alcohol , tobacco or gambling promotion etc . ' Usury ' is forbidden ( paying or charging interest ) and I understand this is a hot topic and what most people are usually asking about when they say sharia banking , but it 's important to be aware that islamic money principles extend well beyond that . Here is how the Islamic Bank of Britain summarises it : "" Central to Islamic finance is the fact that money itself has no intrinsic value . As a matter of faith , a Muslim can not lend money to , or receive money from someone and expect to benefit – interest ( known as riba ) is not allowed . To make money from money is forbidden – wealth can only be generated through legitimate trade and investment in assets . Money must be used in a productive way . The principal means of Islamic finance are based on trading – it is essential that risk be involved in any trading activity . Any gains relating to the trading are shared between the person providing the capital and the person providing the expertise . "" My understanding of how this translates into practical terms is like this : let 's say you want to buy a property / business premises with a mortgage / loan . The total cost of the purchase is £ 100k and the bank requires you to pay a minimum deposit of £ 30k . When the banks are charging interest , you are paying more and more money back for as long as you are in debt . If you fall behind in payments , the debt increases from the original amount because interest is still ticking away on the meter . The banks foreclose on the property and sell it off at whatever cheap price to get a quick sale and recoup the outstanding debt and you are left with nothing , despite paying a hefty £ 30k deposit and ongoing instalments . When you paid £ 30k on a £ 100k home , you would own a 30 % share of the property , so if you had to default , the bank could sell the home but you would get that 30 % share of the sale price back . It is n't the same because they have fundamentally different underlying principles and motivations . The Qur'an mentions that trend in Surah 2 verse 275 : "" Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness . That is because they say : "" Trade is like usury , "" but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury . ... "" . The Qur'an ( 2:275 ) It is worth mentioning as a disclaimer here that there are non - Islamic banks like HSBC etc offering ' shariah compliant finance and products ' but I do not vouch for them or even other ' Islamic banks ' - there may be companies that implement sharia compliance poorly or be swayed by greed for profit at the expense of true compliance . However I hope this helped clarify that Islamic finance principles are there to serve the people of society rather than to deliver Improportionate profits for banks . Wealth should be created out of business and trade , not out of enslaving people into debt .",0,reddit_eli5

In an economic superpower such as the US ? Worldwide ? Please explain like I'm five.,"You could look at Islamic banking , as Sharia Law forbids usury . Islamic banks get around this pretty easily though . At a bank in the western world , if you want a loan to buy a house , the bank gives you the amount of money needed to buy the house and you keep paying the bank interest on the outstanding amount you owe them until you pay the bank off . One example of an approach Islamic banks will take to get around not being able to charge interest is to buy the house , then sell it to you for more than they bought it . You pay the above market sale price back to the bank in installments . So , technically , no interest . There are other more complicated ways around not being able to explicitly charge intrerest as well . In any case , even Islamic banks do n't just lend money without turning a profit .",0,reddit_eli5
18318,"Please explain what is ""AI winter""","In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.The term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the ""American Association of Artificial Intelligence""). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky—two leading AI researchers who had survived the ""winter"" of the 1970s—warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion-dollar AI industry began to collapse.Hype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media. Despite the rise and fall of AI's reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that ""there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day."" In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: ""Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field. Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry. ""Enthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. Beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment.Quantum winter is the prospect of a similar development in quantum computing, anticipated or contemplated by Mikhail Dyakonov, Chris Hoofnagle, Simson Garfinkel, Victor Galitsky, and Nikita Gourianov.",0,wikipedia_csai

16429,What would really happen in terms of employment and the poverty level if the federal minimum wage were to increase ? I get a lot of mixed messages on reddit and do n't know what to believe :/ Explain like I'm five.,"While you might assume that raising the minimum wage is great , ' Hey , more money for everyone at the bottom ' , the reality is more complicated . Raising the minimum wage will often cause lower overall employment , companies will begin to substitute labor for other goods . For example , say you run a fast food joint , that employs 10 people to cook , clean , and serve all the food . They earn minimum wage , and suddenly that cost goes up . As an owner , you look at the cost and realize that you could now save money by only employing 8 people , and instead buying an automatic french fry making machine . So while the 8 people left make more money , two are out of a job because its no longer cost effective to employ them . Another example , say you run a business and minimum wage is $ 7 . You 've figured out that if you hire one more person , you can earn $ 9 more per hour . So you hire the person , earn 9 , pay 7 , and are happy . But now the minimum wage gets raised to $ 10 , you realize that you 'll need to fire that employee , because they no longer make what they cost . It 's often said that the minimum wage takes the bottom rung out of the employment ladder . It can make it particularly hard for young and inexperienced people to find work and get valuable experience .

Please explain like I'm five.,"/u / theseanything is partly right . Observers have found that the incredible skills of many "" savants "" reflect an incredible amount of time spent obsessively practicing or memorizing one thing --- like say the calendar --- allowing them to perform impressive feats --- like telling you the day of the week for any date within 1000 years almost instantly . But , there 's another aspect to some Autistic savants . Researchers have found that some savants have reduced activity in the parts of the fore - brain that are responsible for what we usually think of as information processing --- basically the part of the brain that packages information in a way we understand . In you , presumably , this part of the brain takes a bunch of lines drawn on a piece of paper and tells you that it 's , say , a house . This is why most people 's drawings of a house are house - like , but hardly photo realistic . In the savant , that first step is suppressed . So they see the lines , but they do n't remember it as "" house , "" they remember it as "" bunch of lines . "" So , later , when they try to draw it , there 's no interference from this organizing principle . They just reproduce the lines , sometimes in an order that would make no sense to a non - savant ( part of the roof , than a corner of a window , then the top half of the door ) , and can reproduce it with startling accuracy . The same thing can happen with numbers , allowing for really fast calculation since they do n't have to stop and consider the numbers as "" numbers , "" but just run the operations directly .

19384,Why might it be advisable to keep student debt vs. paying it off quickly?,"I'm no financial advisor, but I do have student loans and I do choose to pay them off as slowly as I can. I will explain my reasoning for doing so. (FWIW, these are all things that pertain to government student loans in the US, not necessarily private student loans, and not necessarily student loans from other countries) So that's my reasoning. $55 per month for the rest of my life adds up to a large amount of money over the course of my life, but the impact month-to-month is essentially nonexistent. That combined with the low interest and the super-low-pressure-sales-tactics means I just literally don't have any incentive to ever pay it all off. Like I said before, I'm just a guy who has student loans, and not even one who is particularly good with money, but as someone who does choose not to pay off my student loans any faster than I have to, this is why.",0,finance

15525,How exactly are pointers useful in c++ ? What is a real scenario that I would need to create and use them ? Explain like I'm five.,"Okay , imagine you are in an office and have a stack of reports stored in a filing cabinet ( the cabinet could be an object in C++ , or a struct or an array , in C / C++ ) . The reports are not allowed to leave the cabinet and go to someone 's desk due to office policy ( and for good reasons ) . Also , it 's wasteful to use so much paper and toner , and it takes time to make copies of a 400 - page report ! If you just need to look at a number or read something , or if you intend to change the file and do n't want to mess up the original , it 's perfectly fine to make a copy . If you 're not working with large amounts of data , maybe only a single variable at a time , then copying is not wasteful or a bad idea . This is what happens when you do n't use pointers . The second option is to keep track of where the files are by storing a "" reference "" to them -- basically writing down on a sticky note that the reports are in "" cabinet B , second from the top , in the third folder "" . This is what a pointer is -- it 's a reference to another variable or set of variables , stored in a variable ( since in this example , variables are pieces of paper ) ! Any time someone needs to change the report , they can look at their reference sticky note , find the file , and make the changes right at the cabinet . This way there 's only one copy , and anyone who has the reference can change the original copy . In C , when you do ` int * ptr = & var ` , you are looking at the filing cabinet / location the file / variable ` var ` is stored , and writing that down on another file / variable called ` ptr ` . When you do ` int var = * ptr ` , you are going to a filing cabinet location stored on the piece of paper ` ptr ` , and writing down what 's in there into ` var ` .",0,reddit_eli5

5910,In Thomas and Friends why does Sir Topham Hatt talk to the engines when there are clearly engineers operating them ? They must be confused by this dude talking to the front of their engines all the time babbling on about being really useful right ? Explain like I'm five. ,"In the Thomas universe , trains are like very smart horses ( think something like Sven in Frozen , but more . ) Given that situation , the engineer still does a job , but it does n't take away from the train having a will of it 's own . or , as this guy on quora put it : > Christian Roden , English major . > Written 21 Mar 2012 > Well , according to the books , the engineers serve the same function as they do in real life . The Thomas and his friends can not function unless they have a proper fire and sufficient steam pressure , and they normally can not run unless the engineer guides them ( though I will admit , the autonomy of the engines was * greatly * increased in the television series ... and I 'm still not sure I agree with that choice ) . > Most of their adventures , in fact , occur when they are going about their daily tasks ( transporting passengers , shunting cars , etc . ) , while their accidents tend to happen when the engineer forgets to properly secure the brake , or somehow loses control . That 's why Thomas is as surprised as everyone else when he suddenly finds himself off the rails . In fact , many of the stories are based on real - life occurrences , thus giving an explanation for the unsolved happenstances that leave everyone puzzling ( could machines be slightly anthropomorphic ? I do n't think it 's likely , though I have grave suspicions about computers ) . It also helps that many engineers , pilots , and sailors have a tendency to personify their craft . > Figures like the engineers are actually quite common in literature , especially children 's literature . They serve as the tollbooth , so to speak , to the bridge between reality and fantasy . Their function is vital , because they enable the "" what if 's "" to be asked . In many children 's books , adult figures serve this function , either by validating or denying the children 's sometimes tangential take on reality . Think about it this way . In the cartoon strip "" Calvin and Hobbs , "" the long - suffering parental figures are the ones who enable his childhood .

15111,What is and how does a ZIP file work ? I ve been looking around and I ca n't find an explanation that I like or fully understand . How do they work and why do they exist ? Explain like I'm five.,"Let 's look really quick at what a file consists of . In the end , it comes down to a bunch of 0s and 1s arranged in a specific pattern , right ? A zip file is a form of lossless compression so that you can package data up tight , send it somewhere , and then unpack it so that it will be the exact same as the original . Lossless means that you can take data , compress it , then uncompress it , and get the orignal data back . There are things called lossy compression ( MP3 files specifically ) that compress by averaging out sections of numbers . I can go into this more if you 'd like So , let 's say that you have a bunch of M & Ms all in a line . They 're either Red or Blue , and you have millions all going along . Let 's start by looking for patterns . For the sake of simplicity of the scenario , you find 100 different patterns that repeat . Either way , you have a bunch of patterns all numbered 1 - 100 . That 's awesome and saves a ton of time . You can also write down the patterns , and the order and save a lot of paper because you 're not writing a list of millions of things . * * * * * Just to elaborate on this real quick . There are different algorithms to define what a pattern is . Basically , you want each pattern to be as long as possible while still not being too unique ( so that it repeats somewhere else ) . You ca n't just say look for the smallest patterns because it would boil down to saying pattern 1 is [ R ] and pattern 2 is [ B ] and here 's the million long list of the order . You also ca n't just say look for the largest because you could say pattern 1 is [ The first half of the sequence ] and pattern 2 is [ The second half of the sequence ] and then the list is just { 1 , 2 } . But both of these would actually make things take longer because you end up telling all of the specifics of the entire sequence ( millions long ) * and * you 're telling them how you broke it into patterns ( more stuff to say ) .

12501,"The difference between a "" font "" and a "" typeface "" And etymology of both words too , if you can . Please explain like I'm five.","/u / secondHandFleshlight is closer to the right answer than anyone else here , but let me expand just slightly . To understand this stuff , it may help to work from the top down . A typeface is one designer 's idealization of the forms of all the symbols desired for printing ( we 'll simplify and say "" letters and numbers "" , though obviously stuff like & and # and $ are included in a typeface ) . As a designer , you may realize those idealized forms in lots of ways . You may make the various strokes of those forms heavier or lighter , as if someone were pressing harder or lighter on a fountain pen . These correspond to descriptors such as "" extra bold "" , "" bold "" , "" demi - bold "" , "" regular "" , "" light "" , "" extra - light "" , and so on . These days , though , most typefaces only come in regular and bold . Size is a continuous variable , of course , and is measured ( for wacko historical reasons ) in units called "" points "" , of which there are 72.27 per inch . Put together any combination of those factors , and you get a font : a set of symbol forms of one overall design , in one style , at one weight , and one particular point size . Obviously , any individual block of metal can and only ever will hold one exact version of a symbol . To keep from going insane , printers organized all these little blocks first by typeface , then by style , weight , and point size , then put them into trays with individual compartments for each symbol . So when the printer yelled at his apprentice to go fetch the "" 12 point Castalon regular demi - bold "" , the poor apprentice would know exactly where to go in the type cases and which wooden tray full of tiny little pieces of very - carefully shaped lead to bring over .",0,reddit_eli5

Let 's take the latter case , where a full sized human stands in at the interaction point at the LHC . First , the beam is made up of ~3,000 packets of 1e11 protons , each with an energy of 7TeV , so the total energy stored in the beam is 3000 * 1e11 * 7 TeV = 2e15 TeV.

That 's kind of like how a record works . The grooves of a record contain tiny , tiny bumps . A needle , usually made of diamond , is attached to a thin , metal strip inside the record player 's tone arm . As the needle travels down the grooves , it hits the bumps and it moves up and down . This causes the metal strip to vibrate . The vibrations are sent to the cartridge , which are then turned into electrical signals , then amplified , and then sent out the speaker as sound . The needle and metal strip are like ears ; they receive the vibration . The cartridge is like a simple brain ; it interprets the vibrations and lets you understand them .",0,reddit_eli5

Firstly , see the post on [ offshore bank accounts ] ( URL_0 ) it explains money laundering as well . So , I 'm a person who wants to make money in a less then legal fashion . Lets say I extort people with threats of burning down their house . I make a million dollars every quarter doing this . For me to spend this money on things I enjoy , it needs to be legitimate . Should the feds take a look at me , because I own a mansion with 12 swimming pools ( I like swimming in different temperatures ) I 'll need to account for where all my money is coming from . So , the money that I get from my extorting , is dirty . I ca n't spend it , or it could be traced back to my illegal activities . I need to make it appear as though I legitimately earned this money . This is where money laundering comes in . I run a legitimate carpet cleaning business . It has a store front , I have carpet cleaning equipment , maybe I even clean a carpet every once in a while . In reality , I rarely clean a carpet , but by the books , this is one of the most successful carpet cleaning business in town . When I get $ 500 from someone in exchange for not burning down their house , I enter this money as profit into the carpet cleaning business . I make appropriate receipts , and even create customers . I can take the money to the bank , and deposit it in the carpet cleaning account . This money , is arguably now "" clean "" . It is appear to be legitimately earned income . I can spend it , as the owner of the carpet cleaning business . Hell , I could even pay taxes on it ( I probably wo n't , see the off shore banking ) . This same thing is done many times , with a great number of businesses . Although a paper trail as simple as the one I laid out could be easily followed , when you do this many times , the trail is harder to follow . So maybe I have an organisation , some of the businesses are more legitimate then others . All of them move money around for me in exchange for a small fee . Some times you actually get something in return , like say , I do n't want to carry around my extorted money . So I go to the butcher and buy some bacon , I get a couple pounds of bacon and spend a few hundred dollars on it . This excess pays to pick up the butchers dry cleaning , a few hundred for a clean pressed shirt . The dry cleaner takes the excess to another business . ( Remember , all this does n't actually have to involve money moving , just the paperwork involved so that when inspected , it appear legitimate ) Lather , rinse , repeat . The money now appears to be legitimately earned income from my many businesses . I am an upstanding and successful business owner and citizen .

Explain like I'm five.","Remember , these are two huge large groups of people in which the individual politicians and their supporters vary widely in both parties . It 's also important to remember that they are n't entirely cohesive . The average republican in a liberal state like California very well may actually be less conservative than the average democrat from a very heavily conservative state like Mississippi . Republics are fiscally and socially conservative . They often use the term "" small government "" , which mostly describes their fiscal beliefs . They believe in Adam Smith 's "" Invisible Hand "" , that capitalism is designed in a way in which it will naturally weed out the business that is dragging the economy down through something that can very loosely be described as a form of social Darwinism . In other words , by regulating the economy to fix it , they are hampering the invisible hand 's ability to fix the economy and thus doing more damage than help . Their positions on social issues do n't always follow the small government mentality to , rather they seem more concerned with basing their social views on things like tradition or religion : pro - life , anti same - sex marriage , anti - gun control , strong military , harsh punishments on crime , pro capital punishment , things like that . Democrats are very much the opposite , tending towards both fiscal and social liberalism . Their views are often based on the creation of a more equal society through the use of government intervention . Fiscally , the are usually for more of mixed economy , meaning they have much less of an issue with government regulations being placed on the business sector . They are often in favor of higher taxes to pay for benefits to the lower class such as food stamps or welfare . Socially , they tend towards being liberal , pro same - sex marriage , gun control , anti capital punishment . It must be noted that , though they are often used in this way in the United States , liberal is not synonymous with democrat , and conservative is not synonymous with republican . For example , you have the libertarian - right that claims conservativism but do n't identify as republicans and the green party 's views usually lie somewhere on the left in most cases , but many members do n't identify as democrats .",0,reddit_eli5

A smile is not always friendly - such as in chimpanzees . However she does say that dogs may pull their lips back when they are panting as mentioned above . This may not be so much a traditional "" smile "" as humans are familiar with it , but a by - product of the pant .

14765,How the British parliamentary system works I understand they have a ' coalition government ' at the moment . But who are the parties ? what do they stand for ? and what is a coalition ? Explain like I'm five.,"As a British citizen , I 'll try my best . Parliament is made of roughly 650 ' seats . ' No , there is n't actually actually 650 chairs , it means you have a place there as a Member of Parliament , MP . The country is divided into constituencies ( areas ) . There are about 650 constituencies . Each constituency elects an MP to represent them in parliament . This aims to represent all areas of the UK . You do n't have to be a party member to run for MP . Pretty much anybody can . Other parties have members running in various constituencies , for example a lot of constituencies have a BNP or Green Party candidate . Some people run independently , without a party . Elections are when every constituency has to elect an MP . Most of the time , a party wins roughly 327 + seats , meaning their party becomes the majority in parliament , and the leader of that party the Prime Minister . When legislation comes to parliament , all MP 's vote , and if a majority of parliament vote for it it goes through to the House Of Lords . In 2010 this changed . The Liberal Democrats , who were always last out of the 3 main parties , gained a * * lot * * of support , through campaigns and excellent debate on television . So the votes were spread more evenly between the 3 , the main ' left wing ' party Labour lost support , so nobody won a majority of seats . Conservative had got the most seats out of the 3 . Conservative seats + Labour seats would have created a parliamentary majority and Conservative + Liberal Democrat seats would have created a parliamentary majority , but Labour + Lib Dem ( the most natural coalition , both being vaguely left wing ) would n't have . So , the Liberal Democrats entered a coalition with the Conservatives . The Conservative leader is our Prime Minister and the Lib Dem leader our deputy PM . They have to at least somewhat work together , as if not when one suggests legislation the other one could get their party not to vote on it , and no legislation would ever pass as both parties would need to vote in support for the majority of parliament to be able to push the legislation through to the next stage . ( While leaders can not force their party members to vote along party lines , they can influence their MP 's to with promises of promotion or threats of never getting promoted etc . There are some MP 's who only want to be MP 's so do n't follow this , but a lot would like promotion . ) An example of this helping each other out ( I think it 's also known as horseplay or something ) would be how in exchange for the Lib Dems voting for the rise in student fees , they got given the Alternative Vote referendum they wanted . ( Look up referendum or AV separately if you 're interested ) . While I like the parliamentary system , I think the voting system needs an overhall . I find STV or AMS more desirable , again look them up if you 're interested . I 'm probably wrong about bits and bobs of this , but hope it helps !",0,reddit_eli5

18905,"Please explain what is ""Digital signal processing""","Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing, such as by computers or more specialized digital signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The digital signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In digital electronics, a digital signal is represented as a pulse train, which is typically generated by the switching of a transistor.Digital signal processing and analog signal processing are subfields of signal processing. DSP applications include audio and speech processing, sonar, radar and other sensor array processing, spectral density estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, data compression, video coding, audio coding, image compression, signal processing for telecommunications, control systems, biomedical engineering, and seismology, among others.DSP can involve linear or nonlinear operations. Nonlinear signal processing is closely related to nonlinear system identification and can be implemented in the time, frequency, and spatio-temporal domains.The application of digital computation to signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as error detection and correction in transmission as well as data compression. Digital signal processing is also fundamental to digital technology, such as digital telecommunication and wireless communications. DSP is applicable to both streaming data and static (stored) data.",0,wikipedia_csai

Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more . But that 's just a theoretical value that would work if all the sound happens at the same place . But it works just fine for most applications .",0,reddit_eli5
2834,"the situation in Homs Syria I know there is fighting going on , but I 'm not quite sure who is fighting who and * * why * * Explain like I'm five.","Bashar Al - Assad is the son of the previous president Hafez Al - Assad . An election was held , but everyone knew he was going to win . Technically he was n't even supposed to be the next president , that role was going to go to his older brother , who was being groomed for the presidency , but he died in a car accident ( officially ruled an accident , but people wonder whether he was killed ) . So , if his older brother was n't killed , there is high chance that Bashar would probably be a doctor in UK right now . Anyway , what you need to realize is that Syria is n't really controlled by Bashar Al - Assad , it 's mostly under the control of the Baa'th party and the military . In fact , for a time , Bashar Al - Assad actually relaxed restrictions on the press when he took control after his father 's death , as well as bringing the internet to Syria in 2001 . Many middle class Syrians generally saw him as an improvement over his father as his time abroad , as well as having the presidency thrust upon him , gave him a more liberal outlook than his dad . However , whether it be fear of appearing weak , or actually being weak and thus pressured by people that have a vested interest in the status quo , he cracked down on political dissidents and media . See , Dictatorial regimes tend to not like the idea of people being free to say whatever they want , as it might lead people to wonder why they put up with leaders that restrict their freedom . The uprising in Syria is a direct response to the perceived successes of the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt as people who are fed up with a political system that benefits the few ( ie the well connected ) at the expense of the rest . Social mobility being limited , poverty , political repression , people disappearing into the night , surveillance etc ... etc ... are all reasons people have for protesting , they just did n't do it because they did n't think that protesting does anything . The Arab Spring showed that "" Hey ! Protesting DID lead to some different results ! "" Now , one of the more important things to realize as a major difference between Libya and Syria , is that Al - Assad does have LEGITIMATE support in the country . I forget where now , but I 've seen statistics that show that around 30 % support the protests , 30 % support Assad , and 30 % are undecided . Although his treatment of protesters in the past few months have probably shifted those numbers . Not to mention , he has the military behind him , whereas Quadafi 's forces were mostly mercenaries he was paying to protect his regime . As to why the US and the rest of the west have n't started bombing Syria , there are generally three main reasons for this . 1 ) China and Russia vetoed even the idea of issuing a condemnation as they have interests in the region ( for example , Russia has a number of arms contracts with Syria ) . 2 ) Al - Assad pays "" lip service "" to the idea that they fight for the Palestinian Cause ( even though Palestinian refugees in Syria are pretty much second - class citizens ) and that he will attack Israel and free Palestine , but never doing anything about it . In fact , there are some protesters seen / arguing that "" hey , Bashar ! This kind of talk , of course , makes Israel very nervous about Al - Assad losing power , so I 'm pretty sure that behind the scenes they are pressuring the US to not do anything about him . 3 ) There is very little , to practically no oil in Syria . Some will point to the fact that most of the oil in Libya was n't even going to the US anyway , but really what matters is n't WHO gets the oil ( ie who gets to import the oil ) , but which COMPANIES get to be the ones that get the contracts to sell the oil . * * TL;DR : People are protesting because life in Syria for some is shitty and there is rampant corruption and limited freedoms . Protests were encouraged by the Arab Spring . The way the situation in Syria is different than Libya is that Al - Assad actually has genuine support from the people and has the full backing of the army . China and Russia are protecting Al - Assad . Israel does n't necessarily want Al - Assad gone . Syria does n't have oil . * *",0,reddit_eli5
3386,Socialism vs. Communism Are they different or are they the same ? Can you point out the important parts in these ideas ? Explain like I'm five.,"They are different , but related . Karl Marx ( the father of communism ) said that socialism is a "" pit stop "" on the way to communism . Socialism is where the state ( and so the people ) own the means of production . Essentially , instead of a private company owning a factory , it might be nationalised so the * nation * owns it . This is meant to stop exploitation of the workers . Communism , however , goes much further . It 's important to note that there has * * never * * been a single communist state in the history of the world . Certain states have * claimed * to be communist , but none ever achieved it as Marx and Engels envisioned . What they wanted was a classless society ( no working classes , middle classes , and upper classes ) where private property does n't exist and everything is owned communally ( hence , ' communism ' . They wanted to create a community ) . People share everything . Because of this , there is no need for currency . People just make everything they need and share it amongst themselves . They do n't make things for * profit * , they make it because they * want * to make it . Communism has a bit of a mantra : "" from each according to their ability to each according to their need "" . It essentially means , "" do what work you can and you 'll get what you need to live "" . Let 's say that you love baking . So , you say "" I want to bake and share this with everyone ! "" . So you open a bakery . Bill comes in in the morning and asks for a loaf of bread . You give it to them , no exchange of money , you just give it to him . Cool ! A shame , but fortunately good ol' Bill who you gave that bread to * loves * making chairs . He 's pretty great at it . You go round his house later and he gives you whichever chair you want . This is what communism is : people sharing , leaving in a community , and not trying to compete against each other . In capitalism , Bill would make that chair to sell ; in communism , he makes that chair to * sit on * . In the final stage of communism the state itself would cease to exist , as people can govern themselves and live without the need for working for profit ( which they called wage - slavery ) . * * tl;dr * * socialism is where the state , and so the people , own the means of production . Communism tries to eliminate currency , the government , property , and the class system .",0,reddit_eli5
11582,Do we really have free will ? I mean if you think about it we are just a bunch of atoms and if you knew the exact position / speed the atoms are moving at in someones brain you could predict what they would think next Explain like I'm five.,"What you talk about is * causal determinism * , also called clockwork / billiards Universe . > if you knew the exact position / speed the atoms are moving at in someones brain you could predict what they would think next This is a mental experiment called "" [ Laplace 's demon ] ( URL_0 ) "" .

13135,Why do computers get slow ? And how can I prevent it ? Please explain like I'm five.,"People like /u / lumpy_potato have covered the "" why "" . I 'm going to talk more about how to prevent it . * * * Stop installing crap you do n't need * * . Do n't install trial games , toolbars , "" accelerators "" , video players recommended by websites or anything else that looks interesting . Only install what you need . * Uninstall all of the useless crap that you installed before you started following the first step . In general , if it 's not made by Microsoft , it 's not a hardware driver , or it 's not software that you use regularly , get rid of it . * Bring in * reputable * Software help . Run malwarebytes or ccleaner to check for malware . Do n't run anything that 's advertised to you . * Make backups . This is a good idea in general , but I mention it here because , if you have backups , you can painlessly ... * Reinstall . One idea that I like : create an account with admin rights and an account without . Use the account without admin rights for day to day work . Only use the admin account when you have to install or upgrade things . ( No web browsing while you 're doing this ! ) That keeps most malware from installing and forces you to stop and think about whether you really need to install the software in question .",0,reddit_eli5

Explain like I'm five.","There is an evolutionary reason for it . Evolutionarily , we only recently discovered soap and other antibacterial substances . Before that every wound was inherently filthy and stayed that way . Scratching as it heals provides a cycle of letting the wound close and rebuild with the need to have the wound seep to expel foreign objects and organisms .",0,reddit_eli5
6689,Why is half of my mortgage payment going to pay interest if my interest rate is 4.5 percent ? I realize it has something to do with amortization but I do n't really understand . Please explain like I'm five.,"One of the points that 's missing from the other answers is that the monthly payments of principal and interest are contrived to be the same over the entire course of the loan . The amortization formula comes up wit a number that means "" If you pay exactly $ X for each and every payment over the N years of the loan , at this interest rate , it will all come out even . "" The last payment is often off by a few dollars , but close enough . Once the amortization formula comes up with that number , the rest is straightforward . The remaining part of the $ X is used to reduce the principal balance . Next month , they do the same calculation , but since the principal balance has gone down , the one month 's worth of interest is also smaller , but the $ X payment amount remains the same . Adding to the confusion is escrow , usually for taxes and insurance . But the part of the payment that goes to principal plus interest is always the same . The could , if they wanted and you wanted , change things so that the principal amount was the same each and every month , and the principal went down . This would result it bigger monthly payments when you first buy the house and smaller ones later on . Most people do n't want this , so mortgages are n't done this way .",0,reddit_eli5
8898,how does the body regenerate blood after donating ? Also when the blood that has been donated is regenerated why / how does the body know it is back to its needed amount ? Explain like I'm five.,Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen and this decreased oxygen in the blood is a stimulus for the kidney to secrete the hormone erythropoietin . This then travels to the bone marrow and stimulates the production of more red blood cells . This is a great example of a negative feedback loop .,0,reddit_eli5

10224,What is preventing Google from spreading Google Fiber to major cities across the US ? title Explain like I'm five.,"So here is a very peculiar business practice that Google has . The point of Google fiber is not to make money , but to influence the market . The hope is that by making the service available that the consumers will pressure existing ISP 's to become more competitive by offering faster speeds at prices that are accessible to more people . They 've used a similar tactic with the Nexus line of phones / tablets which are subsidized by Google , meaning they 're making little to no money off they 're sales .

3275,What are hydraulic systems made out of ? What are hydraulic systems made out of and are there different types ? What kind of materials are they made from ? Explain like I'm five.,"Your basic hydraulic system is : 1 - Pump 2 - Valve Bank 3 - Cylinder / Motor ( cylinder for push / pull , motor for spin ) 4 - Hoses The pump creates flow , that flow is sent to the Valve bank where it is restricted ( to create pressure ) and directed to either a Cylinder , or Motor to do physical work . Hoses connect all these systems together . This is ELI5 , so i m not sure how technical we should get , but inside the valve bank are things called "" Releifs "" . These can come as adjustable ( set what ever pressure you desire ) or non - adjustable ( fixed pressure ) . This is what hydraulic pressure is . What are they made of ? Pump - cast iron housing ( can also be aluminum ) steel / brass interal components . Motor - same as Pump Cylinder - Case iron / steel barrel and rod , Rubber and plastic for seals Hoses - Metall fittings on each end , braided wire and rubber fabric for the hose body Valve Bank - Cast housings , steel , rubber / plastic seals on the releifs . Hopefully this helped .",0,reddit_eli5
